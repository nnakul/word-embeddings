i heard the charming creature get into bed, and shortly breathe hard. as for me, i could not sleep. i lay awake the greater part of the night, afraid to be restless, lest i should disturb miss evelyn and give her reason to think i had been observant of her undressing. when at last i dozed off, it was but to dream of all the charms i had seen. about a month passed thus. every night miss evelyn became more and more at her ease, and confident of my mere childishness, often gave me glorious and lengthened glimpses of her beautifully developed charms although it was only about every other night that i could enjoy them, for, as they always produced sleeplessness afterwards, the following night nature assured her rights, and i usually slept profoundly when i would have preferred continued gazing on the charms of my lovely governess. but, doubtless, those exhausting sleeps helped to throw her off her guard, and gave me better opportunities than i should otherwise have had. once or twice she used the night ware before putting on her nightgown, and i could see the rosy-lipped opening embosomed in exquisite dark curls, pouring out its full measure of water , showing a fine force of nature, and driving me wild with excitement. yet it is singular that i never once thought of applying to my fingers for relief from the painful stiffness that nearly burst my prick asunder. whether mamma had observed my very frequent projection of my trousers, or began to think it better i should not sleep in the same room as miss evelyn, i cannot say, but she had my bed removed into her own. however, i was so thoroughly treated as a mere boy by everyone in the house, that miss evelyn seemed to forget my sex , and there was at all times a freedom of carriage and an abandon in her attitudes that she certainly would not have indulged in if she had felt any restraint from considering herself in the presence of a youth of the age of puberty. in cold weather i used to sit on a low stool by the fire miss evelyn was seated in front, i had my lesson book on my knee, and she herself would place her beautiful feet on the high school fender, with her work in her lap, while she heard my sisters repeat their lesson, totally unconscious that for half an hour at a time she was exposing her beautiful legs and thighs to my ardent gaze , for sitting much below her, and bending my head as if intent on my lesson, my eyes were below her raised petticoats. her close and tight-fitting white stockings displayed her well-formed legs, for while confined to the house during our morning lessons she did not wear drawers , so that in the position she sat in, with her knees higher than her feet on the already high fender, and her legs somewhat apart to hold her work in her lap more easily, the whole glorious underswell of both thighs, and the lower part of her fine large bottom, with the pinky slit quite visible, nestled in a rich profusion of dark curls, were fully exposed to my view. the light from the fire glancing under her raised petticoats tinged the whole with a glow, and set me equally in a blaze of desire until i was almost ready to faint. i could have rushed headlong under her petticoats, and kissed and fondled that delicious opening and all its surroundings. oh, how little she thought of the passion she was raising. oh . dear miss evelyn, how i did love you from the dainty kid slipper and tight glossy silk stocking, up to the glorious swell of the beautiful bubbies, that were so fully exposed to me nearly every night, and the lovely lips of all that i longed to lovingly embrace. thus day after day passed away, and miss evelyn became to me a goddess, a creature whom, in my heart of hearts, i literally worshiped. when she left the schoolroom, and i was alone, i kissed that part of the fender her feet had pressed, and the seat on which she sat, and even the air an inch above, imagination placing there her lovely cunt. i craved for something beyond this without knowing exactly what i wanted , for, as yet, i really was utterly ignorant of anything appertaining to the conjunction of the sexes. one day i had gone up to my sisters' bedroom where the governess slept, that i might throw myself on her bed, and in imagination embrace her beautiful body. i heard someone approaching, and knowing that i had no business there, i hid myself under the bed. the next moment miss evelyn herself entered, and locked the door. it was about an hour before dinner. taking off her dress, and hanging it on the wardrobe, she drew out a piece of furniture, which had been bought for her, the use of which had often puzzled me , she took off the lid, poured water into its basin, and placed a sponge near it. she then took off her gown, drew her petticoats and chemise up to her waist and fastened them there, straddled across it, and seated herself upon it. i thus had the intoxicating delight of gazing on all her beautiful charms, for when she tucked up her clothes she stood before her glass, presenting to my devouring glance her glorious white bottom in all its fullness, turning to approach the bidet, she equally exposed her lower belly and beautiful mount, with all its wealth of hair. while straddling over the bidet before she sat down, the whole of her pinky-lipped cunt broke on my enraptured sight. never shall i forget the wild excitement of the moment. it was almost too much for my excited senses , fortunately, when seated, the immediate cause of my almost madness vanished. she sponged herself well between the thighs for about five minutes. she then raised herself off the bidet, and for a moment again displayed the pouting lips of her cunt then stood fronting me for two or three minutes while she removed, with the rinsed sponge, the trickling drops of water which still gathered on the rich bush of curls around her quim. thus her belly, mount and thighs, whose massy-fleshed and most voluptuous shape were more fully seen by me than they had heretofore been, and it may easily be conceived into what a state such a deliberate view threw me. oh, miss evelyn, dear, delicious miss evelyn . what would you have thought had you known that i was gazing on all your angelic charms, and that my eager eyes had been straining themselves to penetrate the richness of those charming pouting lips which lay so snugly in that rich mass of dark curling hair. oh . how i do long to kiss them , for at that time i had no other idea of embracing and still less of penetrating them. when her ablutions were completed, she sat down and drew off her stockings, displaying her beautiful white calves and charming little feet. i believe it was this first admiration of really exquisitely formed legs, ankles and feet, which were extraordinarily perfect in make, that first awakened my passion for those objects, which have since always exercised a peculiar charm over me. she was also so particularly neat in her shoes little dark ones that were bijoux to look at, i often took them up and kissed them, when left in the room. then her silk stockings, always drawn up tight and fitting like a glove, set off to the greatest advantage the remarkable fine shape of her legs. putting on silk for cotton stockings, she took down a low-bodiced dress, finished her toilet, and left the room. i crawled out from under the bed, washed my face and hands in the water of the bidet, and even drank some in my excitement. some six weeks had now elapsed since the arrival of miss evelyn. the passion that had seized me for her had so far kept me most obedient to her slightest command, or even wish, and, from the same cause, attentive to my lessons, when not distracted by the circumstances already detailed. my example had also had the effect of keeping my sisters much in the same groove, but it was impossible this could last it was not nature. as long as all went smoothly, miss evelyn seemed to be all amiability. we fancied we could do as we liked, and we grew more careless. miss evelyn became more reserved, and cautioned us at first, and then threatened us with the rod. we did not think she would make use of it. mary grew impertinent, and one afternoon turned sulky over her lessons, and set our teacher at defiance. miss evelyn, who had been growing more and more angry, had her rise from her seat. she obeyed with an impudent leer. seizing her by the arm, miss evelyn dragged the struggling girl to the horse. my sister was strong and fought hard, using both teeth and nails, but it was to no purpose. the anger of our governess was fully roused, and raising her in her arms, she carried her forcibly to the horse, placed her on it, held her firmly with one hand while she put the noose round her with the other, which, when drawn, secured her body , other nooses secured each ankle to rings in the floor, keeping her legs apart by the projection of the horse, and also forcing the knees to bend a little, by which the most complete exposure of the bottom, and, in fact, of all her private parts too, was obtained.
