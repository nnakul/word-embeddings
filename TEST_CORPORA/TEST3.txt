the occasion of this interruption we can only explain by resuming the adventures of another set of our characters , for, like old ariosto, we do not pique ourselves upon continuing uniformly to keep company with any one personage of our drama. chapter xviii. away . our journey lies through dell and dingle, where the blithe fawn trips by its timid mother, where the broad oak, with intercepting boughs, chequers the sunbeam in the green-sward alley up and away . for lovely paths are these to tread, when the glad sun is on his throne less pleasant, and less safe, when cynthia's lamp with doubtful glimmer lights the dreary forest. ettrick forest. when cedric the saxon saw his son drop down senseless in the lists at ashby, his first impulse was to order him into the custody and care of his own attendants, but the words choked in his throat. he could not bring himself to acknowledge, in presence of such an assembly, the son whom he had renounced and disinherited. he ordered, however, oswald to keep an eye upon him , and directed that officer, with two of his serfs, to convey ivanhoe to ashby as soon as the crowd had dispersed. oswald, however, was anticipated in this good office. the crowd dispersed, indeed, but the knight was nowhere to be seen. it was in vain that cedric's cupbearer looked around for his young master he saw the bloody spot on which he had lately sunk down, but himself he saw no longer , it seemed as if the fairies had conveyed him from the spot. perhaps oswald for the saxons were very superstitious might have adopted some such hypothesis, to account for ivanhoe's disappearance, had he not suddenly cast his eye upon a person attired like a squire, in whom he recognised the features of his fellow-servant gurth. anxious concerning his master's fate, and in despair at his sudden disappearance, the translated swineherd was searching for him everywhere, and had neglected, in doing so, the concealment on which his own safety depended. oswald deemed it his duty to secure gurth, as a fugitive of whose fate his master was to judge. renewing his enquiries concerning the fate of ivanhoe, the only information which the cupbearer could collect from the bystanders was, that the knight had been raised with care by certain well-attired grooms, and placed in a litter belonging to a lady among the spectators, which had immediately transported him out of the press. oswald, on receiving this intelligence, resolved to return to his master for farther instructions, carrying along with him gurth, whom he considered in some sort as a deserter from the service of cedric. the saxon had been under very intense and agonizing apprehensions concerning his son , for nature had asserted her rights, in spite of the patriotic stoicism which laboured to disown her. but no sooner was he informed that ivanhoe was in careful, and probably in friendly hands, than the paternal anxiety which had been excited by the dubiety of his fate, gave way anew to the feeling of injured pride and resentment, at what he termed wilfred's filial disobedience. "let him wander his way," said he "let those leech his wounds for whose sake he encountered them. he is fitter to do the juggling tricks of the norman chivalry than to maintain the fame and honour of his english ancestry with the glaive and brown-bill, the good old weapons of his country.". "if to maintain the honour of ancestry," said rowena, who was present, "it is sufficient to be wise in council and brave in execution to be boldest among the bold, and gentlest among the gentle, i know no voice, save his father's -". "be silent, lady rowena . on this subject only i hear you not. prepare yourself for the prince's festival we have been summoned thither with unwonted circumstance of honour and of courtesy, such as the haughty normans have rarely used to our race since the fatal day of hastings. thither will i go, were it only to show these proud normans how little the fate of a son, who could defeat their bravest, can affect a saxon.". "thither," said rowena, "do i not go , and i pray you to beware, lest what you mean for courage and constancy, shall be accounted hardness of heart.". "remain at home, then, ungrateful lady," answered cedric , "thine is the hard heart, which can sacrifice the weal of an oppressed people to an idle and unauthorized attachment. i seek the noble athelstane, and with him attend the banquet of john of anjou.". he went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned the principal events. immediately upon retiring from the castle, the saxon thanes, with their attendants, took horse , and it was during the bustle which attended their doing so, that cedric, for the first time, cast his eyes upon the deserter gurth. the noble saxon had returned from the banquet, as we have seen, in no very placid humour, and wanted but a pretext for wreaking his anger upon some one. "the gyves . " he said, "the gyves . oswald hundibert . dogs and villains . why leave ye the knave unfettered . ". without daring to remonstrate, the companions of gurth bound him with a halter, as the readiest cord which occurred. he submitted to the operation without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful look at his master, he said, "this comes of loving your flesh and blood better than mine own.". "to horse, and forward . " said cedric. "it is indeed full time," said the noble athelstane , "for, if we ride not the faster, the worthy abbot waltheoff's preparations for a rere-supper . . will be altogether spoiled.". the travellers, however, used such speed as to reach the convent of st withold's before the apprehended evil took place. the abbot, himself of ancient saxon descent, received the noble saxons with the profuse and exuberant hospitality of their nation, wherein they indulged to a late, or rather an early hour , nor did they take leave of their reverend host the next morning until they had shared with him a sumptuous refection. as the cavalcade left the court of the monastery, an incident happened somewhat alarming to the saxons, who, of all people of europe, were most addicted to a superstitious observance of omens, and to whose opinions can be traced most of those notions upon such subjects, still to be found among our popular antiquities. for the normans being a mixed race, and better informed according to the information of the times, had lost most of the superstitious prejudices which their ancestors had brought from scandinavia, and piqued themselves upon thinking freely on such topics. in the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was inspired by no less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog, which, sitting upright, howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the gate, and presently afterwards, barking wildly, and jumping to and fro, seemed bent upon attaching itself to the party. "i like not that music, father cedric," said athelstane , for by this title of respect he was accustomed to address him. "nor i either, uncle," said wamba , "i greatly fear we shall have to pay the piper.". "in my mind," said athelstane, upon whose memory the abbot's good ale for burton was already famous for that genial liquor had made a favourable impression, "in my mind we had better turn back, and abide with the abbot until the afternoon. it is unlucky to travel where your path is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, until you have eaten your next meal.". "away . " said cedric, impatiently , "the day is already too short for our journey. for the dog, i know it to be the cur of the runaway slave gurth, a useless fugitive like its master.". so saying, and rising at the same time in his stirrups, impatient at the interruption of his journey, he launched his javelin at poor fangs for fangs it was, who, having traced his master thus far upon his stolen expedition, had here lost him, and was now, in his uncouth way, rejoicing at his reappearance. the javelin inflicted a wound upon the animal's shoulder, and narrowly missed pinning him to the earth , and fangs fled howling from the presence of the enraged thane. gurth's heart swelled within him , for he felt this meditated slaughter of his faithful adherent in a degree much deeper than the harsh treatment he had himself received. having in vain attempted to raise his hand to his eyes, he said to wamba, who, seeing his master's ill humour had prudently retreated to the rear, "i pray thee, do me the kindness to wipe my eyes with the skirt of thy mantle , the dust offends me, and these bonds will not let me help myself one way or another.". wamba did him the service he required, and they rode side by side for some time, during which gurth maintained a moody silence. at length he could repress his feelings no longer. "friend wamba," said he, "of all those who are fools enough to serve cedric, thou alone hast dexterity enough to make thy folly acceptable to him. go to him, therefore, and tell him that neither for love nor fear will gurth serve him longer. he may strike the head from me he may scourge me he may load me with irons but henceforth he shall never compel me either to love or to obey him. go to him, then, and tell him that gurth the son of beowulph renounces his service.". "assuredly," said wamba, "fool as i am, i shall not do your fool's errand. cedric hath another javelin stuck into his girdle, and thou knowest he does not always miss his mark.". "i care not," replied gurth, "how soon he makes a mark of me. yesterday he left wilfred, my young master, in his blood. to-day he has striven to kill before my face the only other living creature that ever showed me kindness. by st edmund, st dunstan, st withold, st edward the confessor, and every other saxon saint in the calendar," for cedric never swore by any that was not of saxon lineage, and all his household had the same limited devotion, "i will never forgive him . ". "to my thinking now," said the jester, who was frequently wont to act as peace-maker in the family, "our master did not propose to hurt fangs, but only to affright him. for, if you observed, he rose in his stirrups, as thereby meaning to overcast the mark , and so he would have done, but fangs happening to bound up at the very moment, received a scratch, which i will be bound to heal with a penny's breadth of tar.". "if i thought so," said gurth "if i could but think so but no i saw the javelin was well aimed i heard it whizz through the air with all the wrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it quivered after it had pitched in the ground, as if with regret for having missed its mark. by the hog dear to st anthony, i renounce him . ". and the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no efforts of the jester could again induce him to break. meanwhile cedric and athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed together on the state of the land, on the dissensions of the royal family, on the feuds and quarrels among the norman nobles, and on the chance which there was that the oppressed saxons might be able to free themselves from the yoke of the normans, or at least to elevate themselves into national consequence and independence, during the civil convulsions which were likely to ensue. on this subject cedric was all animation. the restoration of the independence of his race was the idol of his heart, to which he had willingly sacrificed domestic happiness and the interests of his own son. but, in order to achieve this great revolution in favour of the native english, it was necessary that they should be united among themselves, and act under an acknowledged head. the necessity of choosing their chief from the saxon blood-royal was not only evident in itself, but had been made a solemn condition by those whom cedric had intrusted with his secret plans and hopes. athelstane had this quality at least , and though he had few mental accomplishments or talents to recommend him as a leader, he had still a goodly person, was no coward, had been accustomed to martial exercises, and seemed willing to defer to the advice of counsellors more wise than himself. above all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable, and believed to be good-natured. but whatever pretensions athelstane had to be considered as head of the saxon confederacy, many of that nation were disposed to prefer to the title of the lady rowena, who drew her descent from alfred, and whose father having been a chief renowned for wisdom, courage, and generosity, his memory was highly honoured by his oppressed countrymen. it would have been no difficult thing for cedric, had he been so disposed, to have placed himself at the head of a third party, as formidable at least as any of the others. to counterbalance their royal descent, he had courage, activity, energy, and, above all, that devoted attachment to the cause which had procured him the epithet of the saxon, and his birth was inferior to none, excepting only that of athelstane and his ward. these qualities, however, were unalloyed by the slightest shade of selfishness , and, instead of dividing yet farther his weakened nation by forming a faction of his own, it was a leading part of cedric's plan to extinguish that which already existed, by promoting a marriage betwixt rowena and athelstane. an obstacle occurred to this his favourite project, in the mutual attachment of his ward and his son and hence the original cause of the banishment of wilfred from the house of his father. this stern measure cedric had adopted, in hopes that, during wilfred's absence, rowena might relinquish her preference, but in this hope he was disappointed , a disappointment which might be attributed in part to the mode in which his ward had been educated. cedric, to whom the name of alfred was as that of a deity, had treated the sole remaining scion of that great monarch with a degree of observance, such as, perhaps, was in those days scarce paid to an acknowledged princess. rowena's will had been in almost all cases a law to his household , and cedric himself, as if determined that her sovereignty should be fully acknowledged within that little circle at least, seemed to take a pride in acting as the first of her subjects. thus trained in the exercise not only of free will, but despotic authority, rowena was, by her previous education, disposed both to resist and to resent any attempt to control her affections, or dispose of her hand contrary to her inclinations, and to assert her independence in a case in which even those females who have been trained up to obedience and subjection, are not infrequently apt to dispute the authority of guardians and parents. the opinions which she felt strongly, she avowed boldly , and cedric, who could not free himself from his habitual deference to her opinions, felt totally at a loss how to enforce his authority of guardian. it was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a visionary throne. rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither considered his plan as practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was concerned, could it have been achieved. from these rovers, however, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour cedric and athelstane accounted themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides wamba and gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester and the other a captive. it may be added, that in travelling thus late through the forest, cedric and athelstane relied on their descent and character, as well as their courage. the outlaws, whom the severity of the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life, were chiefly peasants and yeomen of saxon descent, and were generally supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen. as the travellers journeyed on their way, they were alarmed by repeated cries for assistance , and when they rode up to the place from whence they came, they were surprised to find a horse-litter placed upon the ground, beside which sat a young woman, richly dressed in the jewish fashion, while an old man, whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong to the same nation, walked up and down with gestures expressive of the deepest despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected by some strange disaster. to the enquiries of athelstane and cedric, the old jew could for some time only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the old testament successively against the sons of ishmael, who were coming to smite them, hip and thigh, with the edge of the sword. when he began to come to himself out of this agony of terror, isaac of york for it was our old friend was at length able to explain, that he had hired a body-guard of six men at ashby, together with mules for carrying the litter of a sick friend. this party had undertaken to escort him as far as doncaster. they had come thus far in safety , but having received information from a wood-cutter that there was a strong band of outlaws lying in wait in the woods before them, isaac's mercenaries had not only taken flight, but had carried off with them the horses which bore the litter and left the jew and his daughter without the means either of defence or of retreat, to be plundered, and probably murdered, by the banditti, who they expected every moment would bring down upon them. "would it but please your valours," added isaac, in a tone of deep humiliation, "to permit the poor jews to travel under your safeguard, i swear by the tables of our law, that never has favour been conferred upon a child of israel since the days of our captivity, which shall be more gratefully acknowledged.". "dog of a jew . " said athelstane, whose memory was of that petty kind which stores up trifles of all kinds, but particularly trifling offences, "dost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at the tilt-yard . fight or flee, or compound with the outlaws as thou dost list, ask neither aid nor company from us , and if they rob only such as thee, who rob all the world, i, for mine own share, shall hold them right honest folk.". cedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. "we shall do better," said he, "to leave them two of our attendants and two horses to convey them back to the next village. it will diminish our strength but little , and with your good sword, noble athelstane, and the aid of those who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those runagates.". rowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so near them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. but rebecca suddenly quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the attendants to the palfrey of the saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the oriental fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of rowena's garment. then rising, and throwing back her veil, she implored her in the great name of the god whom they both worshipped, and by that revelation of the law upon mount sinai, in which they both believed, that she would have compassion upon them, and suffer them to go forward under their safeguard. "it is not for myself that i pray this favour," said rebecca , "nor is it even for that poor old man. i know that to wrong and to spoil our nation is a light fault, if not a merit, with the christians , and what is it to us whether it be done in the city, in the desert, or in the field . but it is in the name of one dear to many, and dear even to you, that i beseech you to let this sick person be transported with care and tenderness under your protection. for, if evil chance him, the last moment of your life would be embittered with regret for denying that which i ask of you.". the noble and solemn air with which rebecca made this appeal, gave it double weight with the fair saxon. "the man is old and feeble," she said to her guardian, "the maiden young and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life jews though they be, we cannot as christians leave them in this extremity. let them unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of the serfs. the mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for the old man and his daughter.". cedric readily assented to what she proposed, and athelstane only added the condition, "that they should travel in the rear of the whole party, where wamba," he said, "might attend them with his shield of boar's brawn.". "i have left my shield in the tilt-yard," answered the jester, "as has been the fate of many a better knight than myself.". athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the last day of the tournament , while rowena, who was pleased in the same proportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling suitor, requested rebecca to ride by her side. "it were not fit i should do so," answered rebecca, with proud humility, "where my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress.". by this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved , for the single word "outlaws" rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach of twilight made the sound yet more impressive. amid the bustle, gurth was taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed upon the jester to slack the cord with which his arms were bound. it was so negligently refastened, perhaps intentionally, on the part of wamba, that gurth found no difficulty in freeing his arms altogether from bondage, and then, gliding into the thicket, he made his escape from the party. the bustle had been considerable, and it was some time before gurth was missed , for, as he was to be placed for the rest of the journey behind a servant, every one supposed that some other of his companions had him under his custody, and when it began to be whispered among them that gurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate expectation of an attack from the outlaws, that it was not held convenient to pay much attention to the circumstance. the path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to admit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and began to descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken, swampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows. cedric and athelstane, who were at the head of their retinue, saw the risk of being attacked at this pass , but neither of them having had much practice in war, no better mode of preventing the danger occurred to them than that they should hasten through the defile as fast as possible. advancing, therefore, without much order, they had just crossed the brook with a part of their followers, when they were assailed in front, flank, and rear at once, with an impetuosity to which, in their confused and ill-prepared condition, it was impossible to offer effectual resistance. the shout of "a white dragon . a white dragon . saint george for merry england . " war-cries adopted by the assailants, as belonging to their assumed character of saxon outlaws, was heard on every side, and on every side enemies appeared with a rapidity of advance and attack which seemed to multiply their numbers. both the saxon chiefs were made prisoners at the same moment, and each under circumstances expressive of his character. cedric, the instant that an enemy appeared, launched at him his remaining javelin, which, taking better effect than that which he had hurled at fangs, nailed the man against an oak-tree that happened to be close behind him.
