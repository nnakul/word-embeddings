the apartment in which the saxon chiefs were confined, for to them we turn our first attention, although at present used as a sort of guard-room, had formerly been the great hall of the castle. it was now abandoned to meaner purposes, because the present lord, among other additions to the convenience, security, and beauty of his baronial residence, had erected a new and noble hall, whose vaulted roof was supported by lighter and more elegant pillars, and fitted up with that higher degree of ornament, which the normans had already introduced into architecture. cedric paced the apartment, filled with indignant reflections on the past and on the present, while the apathy of his companion served, instead of patience and philosophy, to defend him against every thing save the inconvenience of the present moment , and so little did he feel even this last, that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by cedric's animated and impassioned appeal to him. "yes," said cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing himself to athelstane, "it was in this very hall that my father feasted with torquil wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate harold, then advancing against the norwegians, who had united themselves to the rebel tosti. it was in this hall that harold returned the magnanimous answer to the ambassador of his rebel brother. oft have i heard my father kindle as he told the tale. the envoy of tosti was admitted, when this ample room could scarce contain the crowd of noble saxon leaders, who were quaffing the blood-red wine around their monarch.". "i hope," said athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his friend's discourse, "they will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at noon we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and i never have the benefit of my food when i eat immediately after dismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice.". cedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional observation of his friend. "the envoy of tosti," he said, "moved up the hall, undismayed by the frowning countenances of all around him, until he made his obeisance before the throne of king harold. "'what terms,' he said, 'lord king, hath thy brother tosti to hope, if he should lay down his arms, and crave peace at thy hands . '. "'a brother's love,' cried the generous harold, 'and the fair earldom of northumberland.'. "'but should tosti accept these terms,' continued the envoy, 'what lands shall be assigned to his faithful ally, hardrada, king of norway . '. "'seven feet of english ground,' answered harold, fiercely, 'or, as hardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelve inches more.'. "the hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was filled to the norwegian, who should be speedily in possession of his english territory.". "i could have pledged him with all my soul," said athelstane, "for my tongue cleaves to my palate.". "the baffled envoy," continued cedric, pursuing with animation his tale, though it interested not the listener, "retreated, to carry to tosti and his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. it was then that the distant towers of york, and the bloody streams of the derwent, . . beheld that direful conflict, in which, after displaying the most undaunted valour, the king of norway, and tosti, both fell, with ten thousand of their bravest followers. who would have thought that upon the proud day when this battle was won, the very gale which waved the saxon banners in triumph, was filling the norman sails, and impelling them to the fatal shores of sussex . who would have thought that harold, within a few brief days, would himself possess no more of his kingdom, than the share which he allotted in his wrath to the norwegian invader . who would have thought that you, noble athelstane that you, descended of harold's blood, and that i, whose father was not the worst defender of the saxon crown, should be prisoners to a vile norman, in the very hall in which our ancestors held such high festival . ". "it is sad enough," replied athelstane , "but i trust they will hold us to a moderate ransom at any rate it cannot be their purpose to starve us outright , and yet, although it is high noon, i see no preparations for serving dinner. look up at the window, noble cedric, and judge by the sunbeams if it is not on the verge of noon.". "it may be so," answered cedric , "but i cannot look on that stained lattice without its awakening other reflections than those which concern the passing moment, or its privations. when that window was wrought, my noble friend, our hardy fathers knew not the art of making glass, or of staining it the pride of wolfganger's father brought an artist from normandy to adorn his hall with this new species of emblazonment, that breaks the golden light of god's blessed day into so many fantastic hues. the foreigner came here poor, beggarly, cringing, and subservient, ready to doff his cap to the meanest native of the household. he returned pampered and proud, to tell his rapacious countrymen of the wealth and the simplicity of the saxon nobles a folly, oh, athelstane, foreboded of old, as well as foreseen, by those descendants of hengist and his hardy tribes, who retained the simplicity of their manners. we made these strangers our bosom friends, our confidential servants , we borrowed their artists and their arts, and despised the honest simplicity and hardihood with which our brave ancestors supported themselves, and we became enervated by norman arts long ere we fell under norman arms. far better was our homely diet, eaten in peace and liberty, than the luxurious dainties, the love of which hath delivered us as bondsmen to the foreign conqueror . ". "most accursed dog of an accursed race," he said, awaking with his deep and sullen voice the sullen echoes of his dungeon vault, "seest thou these scales . ". the unhappy jew returned a feeble affirmative. "in these very scales shalt thou weigh me out," said the relentless baron, "a thousand silver pounds, after the just measure and weight of the tower of london.". "holy abraham . " returned the jew, finding voice through the very extremity of his danger, "heard man ever such a demand . who ever heard, even in a minstrel's tale, of such a sum as a thousand pounds of silver . what human sight was ever blessed with the vision of such a mass of treasure . not within the walls of york, ransack my house and that of all my tribe, wilt thou find the tithe of that huge sum of silver that thou speakest of.". "i am reasonable," answered front-de-boeuf, "and if silver be scant, i refuse not gold. at the rate of a mark of gold for each six pounds of silver, thou shalt free thy unbelieving carcass from such punishment as thy heart has never even conceived.". "have mercy on me, noble knight . " exclaimed isaac , "i am old, and poor, and helpless. it were unworthy to triumph over me it is a poor deed to crush a worm.". "old thou mayst be," replied the knight , "more shame to their folly who have suffered thee to grow grey in usury and knavery feeble thou mayst be, for when had a jew either heart or hand but rich it is well known thou art.". "i swear to you, noble knight," said the jew "by all which i believe, and by all which we believe in common -". "perjure not thyself," said the norman, interrupting him, "and let not thine obstinacy seal thy doom, until thou hast seen and well considered the fate that awaits thee. think not i speak to thee only to excite thy terror, and practise on the base cowardice thou hast derived from thy tribe. i swear to thee by that which thou dost not believe, by the gospel which our church teaches, and by the keys which are given her to bind and to loose, that my purpose is deep and peremptory. this dungeon is no place for trifling. prisoners ten thousand times more distinguished than thou have died within these walls, and their fate hath never been known . but for thee is reserved a long and lingering death, to which theirs were luxury.". he again made a signal for the slaves to approach, and spoke to them apart, in their own language , for he also had been in palestine, where perhaps, he had learnt his lesson of cruelty. the saracens produced from their baskets a quantity of charcoal, a pair of bellows, and a flask of oil. while the one struck a light with a flint and steel, the other disposed the charcoal in the large rusty grate which we have already mentioned, and exercised the bellows until the fuel came to a red glow. "seest thou, isaac," said front-de-boeuf, "the range of iron bars above the glowing charcoal . . . on that warm couch thou shalt lie, stripped of thy clothes as if thou wert to rest on a bed of down. one of these slaves shall maintain the fire beneath thee, while the other shall anoint thy wretched limbs with oil, lest the roast should burn. now, choose betwixt such a scorching bed and the payment of a thousand pounds of silver , for, by the head of my father, thou hast no other option.". "it is impossible," exclaimed the miserable jew "it is impossible that your purpose can be real . the good god of nature never made a heart capable of exercising such cruelty . ". "trust not to that, isaac," said front-de-boeuf, "it were a fatal error. dost thou think that i, who have seen a town sacked, in which thousands of my christian countrymen perished by sword, by flood, and by fire, will blench from my purpose for the outcries or screams of one single wretched jew . or thinkest thou that these swarthy slaves, who have neither law, country, nor conscience, but their master's will who use the poison, or the stake, or the poniard, or the cord, at his slightest wink thinkest thou that they will have mercy, who do not even understand the language in which it is asked . be wise, old man , discharge thyself of a portion of thy superfluous wealth , repay to the hands of a christian a part of what thou hast acquired by the usury thou hast practised on those of his religion. thy cunning may soon swell out once more thy shrivelled purse, but neither leech nor medicine can restore thy scorched hide and flesh wert thou once stretched on these bars. tell down thy ransom, i say, and rejoice that at such rate thou canst redeem thee from a dungeon, the secrets of which few have returned to tell. i waste no more words with thee choose between thy dross and thy flesh and blood, and as thou choosest, so shall it be.". "so may abraham, jacob, and all the fathers of our people assist me," said isaac, "i cannot make the choice, because i have not the means of satisfying your exorbitant demand . ". "seize him and strip him, slaves," said the knight, "and let the fathers of his race assist him if they can.". the assistants, taking their directions more from the baron's eye and his hand than his tongue, once more stepped forward, laid hands on the unfortunate isaac, plucked him up from the ground, and, holding him between them, waited the hard-hearted baron's farther signal. the unhappy jew eyed their countenances and that of front-de-boeuf, in hope of discovering some symptoms of relenting , but that of the baron exhibited the same cold, half-sullen, half-sarcastic smile which had been the prelude to his cruelty , and the savage eyes of the saracens, rolling gloomily under their dark brows, acquiring a yet more sinister expression by the whiteness of the circle which surrounds the pupil, evinced rather the secret pleasure which they expected from the approaching scene, than any reluctance to be its directors or agents. the jew then looked at the glowing furnace, over which he was presently to be stretched, and seeing no chance of his tormentor's relenting, his resolution gave way. "i will pay," he said, "the thousand pounds of silver that is," he added, after a moment's pause, "i will pay it with the help of my brethren , for i must beg as a mendicant at the door of our synagogue ere i make up so unheard-of a sum. when and where must it be delivered . ". "here," replied front-de-boeuf, "here it must be delivered weighed it must be weighed and told down on this very dungeon floor. thinkest thou i will part with thee until thy ransom is secure . ". "and what is to be my surety," said the jew, "that i shall be at liberty after this ransom is paid . ". "the word of a norman noble, thou pawn-broking slave," answered front-de-boeuf , "the faith of a norman nobleman, more pure than the gold and silver of thee and all thy tribe.". "i crave pardon, noble lord," said isaac timidly, "but wherefore should i rely wholly on the word of one who will trust nothing to mine . ". "because thou canst not help it, jew," said the knight, sternly. "wert thou now in thy treasure-chamber at york, and were i craving a loan of thy shekels, it would be thine to dictate the time of payment, and the pledge of security. this is my treasure-chamber. here i have thee at advantage, nor will i again deign to repeat the terms on which i grant thee liberty.". the jew groaned deeply. "grant me," he said, "at least with my own liberty, that of the companions with whom i travel. they scorned me as a jew, yet they pitied my desolation, and because they tarried to aid me by the way, a share of my evil hath come upon them , moreover, they may contribute in some sort to my ransom.". "if thou meanest yonder saxon churls," said front-de-boeuf, "their ransom will depend upon other terms than thine. mind thine own concerns, jew, i warn thee, and meddle not with those of others.". "i am, then," said isaac, "only to be set at liberty, together with mine wounded friend . ". "shall i twice recommend it," said front-de-boeuf, "to a son of israel, to meddle with his own concerns, and leave those of others alone . since thou hast made thy choice, it remains but that thou payest down thy ransom, and that at a short day.". "yet hear me," said the jew "for the sake of that very wealth which thou wouldst obtain at the expense of thy -" here he stopt short, afraid of irritating the savage norman. but front-de-boeuf only laughed, and himself filled up the blank at which the jew had hesitated. "at the expense of my conscience, thou wouldst say, isaac , speak it out i tell thee, i am reasonable. i can bear the reproaches of a loser, even when that loser is a jew. thou wert not so patient, isaac, when thou didst invoke justice against jacques fitzdotterel, for calling thee a usurious blood-sucker, when thy exactions had devoured his patrimony.". "i swear by the talmud," said the jew, "that your valour has been misled in that matter. fitzdotterel drew his poniard upon me in mine own chamber, because i craved him for mine own silver. the term of payment was due at the passover.". "i care not what he did," said front-de-boeuf , "the question is, when shall i have mine own . when shall i have the shekels, isaac . ". "let my daughter rebecca go forth to york," answered isaac, "with your safe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horse can return, the treasure -" here he groaned deeply, but added, after the pause of a few seconds, "the treasure shall be told down on this very floor.". "thy daughter . " said front-de-boeuf, as if surprised, "by heavens, isaac, i would i had known of this. i deemed that yonder black-browed girl had been thy concubine, and i gave her to be a handmaiden to sir brian de bois-guilbert, after the fashion of patriarchs and heroes of the days of old, who set us in these matters a wholesome example.". the yell which isaac raised at this unfeeling communication made the very vault to ring, and astounded the two saracens so much that they let go their hold of the jew. he availed himself of his enlargement to throw himself on the pavement, and clasp the knees of front-de-boeuf. "take all that you have asked," said he, "sir knight take ten times more reduce me to ruin and to beggary, if thou wilt, nay, pierce me with thy poniard, broil me on that furnace, but spare my daughter, deliver her in safety and honour . as thou art born of woman, spare the honour of a helpless maiden she is the image of my deceased rachel, she is the last of six pledges of her love will you deprive a widowed husband of his sole remaining comfort . will you reduce a father to wish that his only living child were laid beside her dead mother, in the tomb of our fathers . ". "i would," said the norman, somewhat relenting, "that i had known of this before. i thought your race had loved nothing save their moneybags.". "think not so vilely of us, jews though we be," said isaac, eager to improve the moment of apparent sympathy , "the hunted fox, the tortured wildcat loves its young the despised and persecuted race of abraham love their children . ". "be it so," said front-de-boeuf , "i will believe it in future, isaac, for thy very sake but it aids us not now, i cannot help what has happened, or what is to follow , my word is passed to my comrade in arms, nor would i break it for ten jews and jewesses to boot. besides, why shouldst thou think evil is to come to the girl, even if she became bois-guilbert's booty . ". "there will, there must . " exclaimed isaac, wringing his hands in agony , "when did templars breathe aught but cruelty to men, and dishonour to women . ". "dog of an infidel," said front-de-boeuf, with sparkling eyes, and not sorry, perhaps, to seize a pretext for working himself into a passion, "blaspheme not the holy order of the temple of zion, but take thought instead to pay me the ransom thou hast promised, or woe betide thy jewish throat . ". "robber and villain . " said the jew, retorting the insults of his oppressor with passion, which, however impotent, he now found it impossible to bridle, "i will pay thee nothing not one silver penny will i pay thee, unless my daughter is delivered to me in safety and honour . ". "art thou in thy senses, israelite . " said the norman, sternly "has thy flesh and blood a charm against heated iron and scalding oil . ". "i care not . " said the jew, rendered desperate by paternal affection , "do thy worst. my daughter is my flesh and blood, dearer to me a thousand times than those limbs which thy cruelty threatens. no silver will i give thee, unless i were to pour it molten down thy avaricious throat no, not a silver penny will i give thee, nazarene, were it to save thee from the deep damnation thy whole life has merited . take my life if thou wilt, and say, the jew, amidst his tortures, knew how to disappoint the christian.". "we shall see that," said front-de-boeuf , "for by the blessed rood, which is the abomination of thy accursed tribe, thou shalt feel the extremities of fire and steel . strip him, slaves, and chain him down upon the bars.". in spite of the feeble struggles of the old man, the saracens had already torn from him his upper garment, and were proceeding totally to disrobe him, when the sound of a bugle, twice winded without the castle, penetrated even to the recesses of the dungeon, and immediately after loud voices were heard calling for sir reginald front-de-boeuf. unwilling to be found engaged in his hellish occupation, the savage baron gave the slaves a signal to restore isaac's garment, and, quitting the dungeon with his attendants, he left the jew to thank god for his own deliverance, or to lament over his daughter's captivity, and probable fate, as his personal or parental feelings might prove strongest. chapter xxiii. nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words can no way change you to a milder form, i'll woo you, like a soldier, at arms' end, and love you 'gainst the nature of love, force you. two gentlemen of verona. the apartment to which the lady rowena had been introduced was fitted up with some rude attempts at ornament and magnificence, and her being placed there might be considered as a peculiar mark of respect not offered to the other prisoners. but the wife of front-de-boeuf, for whom it had been originally furnished, was long dead, and decay and neglect had impaired the few ornaments with which her taste had adorned it. the tapestry hung down from the walls in many places, and in others was tarnished and faded under the effects of the sun, or tattered and decayed by age. desolate, however, as it was, this was the apartment of the castle which had been judged most fitting for the accommodation of the saxon heiress , and here she was left to meditate upon her fate, until the actors in this nefarious drama had arranged the several parts which each of them was to perform. this had been settled in a council held by front-de-boeuf, de bracy, and the templar, in which, after a long and warm debate concerning the several advantages which each insisted upon deriving from his peculiar share in this audacious enterprise, they had at length determined the fate of their unhappy prisoners. it was about the hour of noon, therefore, when de bracy, for whose advantage the expedition had been first planned, appeared to prosecute his views upon the hand and possessions of the lady rowena. the interval had not entirely been bestowed in holding council with his confederates, for de bracy had found leisure to decorate his person with all the foppery of the times. his green cassock and vizard were now flung aside. his long luxuriant hair was trained to flow in quaint tresses down his richly furred cloak. his beard was closely shaved, his doublet reached to the middle of his leg, and the girdle which secured it, and at the same time supported his ponderous sword, was embroidered and embossed with gold work. we have already noticed the extravagant fashion of the shoes at this period, and the points of maurice de bracy's might have challenged the prize of extravagance with the gayest, being turned up and twisted like the horns of a ram. such was the dress of a gallant of the period , and, in the present instance, that effect was aided by the handsome person and good demeanour of the wearer, whose manners partook alike of the grace of a courtier, and the frankness of a soldier. he saluted rowena by doffing his velvet bonnet, garnished with a golden broach, representing st michael trampling down the prince of evil. with this, he gently motioned the lady to a seat , and, as she still retained her standing posture, the knight ungloved his right hand, and motioned to conduct her thither. but rowena declined, by her gesture, the proffered compliment, and replied, "if i be in the presence of my jailor, sir knight nor will circumstances allow me to think otherwise it best becomes his prisoner to remain standing till she learns her doom.". "alas . fair rowena," returned de bracy, "you are in presence of your captive, not your jailor , and it is from your fair eyes that de bracy must receive that doom which you fondly expect from him.". "i know you not, sir," said the lady, drawing herself up with all the pride of offended rank and beauty , "i know you not and the insolent familiarity with which you apply to me the jargon of a troubadour, forms no apology for the violence of a robber.". "to thyself, fair maid," answered de bracy, in his former tone "to thine own charms be ascribed whate'er i have done which passed the respect due to her, whom i have chosen queen of my heart, and lodestar of my eyes.". "i repeat to you, sir knight, that i know you not, and that no man wearing chain and spurs ought thus to intrude himself upon the presence of an unprotected lady.". "that i am unknown to you," said de bracy, "is indeed my misfortune , yet let me hope that de bracy's name has not been always unspoken, when minstrels or heralds have praised deeds of chivalry, whether in the lists or in the battle-field.". "to heralds and to minstrels, then, leave thy praise, sir knight," replied rowena, "more suiting for their mouths than for thine own , and tell me which of them shall record in song, or in book of tourney, the memorable conquest of this night, a conquest obtained over an old man, followed by a few timid hinds , and its booty, an unfortunate maiden, transported against her will to the castle of a robber . ". "you are unjust, lady rowena," said the knight, biting his lips in some confusion, and speaking in a tone more natural to him than that of affected gallantry, which he had at first adopted , "yourself free from passion, you can allow no excuse for the frenzy of another, although caused by your own beauty.". "i pray you, sir knight," said rowena, "to cease a language so commonly used by strolling minstrels, that it becomes not the mouth of knights or nobles. certes, you constrain me to sit down, since you enter upon such commonplace terms, of which each vile crowder hath a stock that might last from hence to christmas.". "proud damsel," said de bracy, incensed at finding his gallant style procured him nothing but contempt "proud damsel, thou shalt be as proudly encountered. know then, that i have supported my pretensions to your hand in the way that best suited thy character. it is meeter for thy humour to be wooed with bow and bill, than in set terms, and in courtly language.". "courtesy of tongue," said rowena, "when it is used to veil churlishness of deed, is but a knight's girdle around the breast of a base clown. i wonder not that the restraint appears to gall you more it were for your honour to have retained the dress and language of an outlaw, than to veil the deeds of one under an affectation of gentle language and demeanour.". "you counsel well, lady," said the norman , "and in the bold language which best justifies bold action i tell thee, thou shalt never leave this castle, or thou shalt leave it as maurice de bracy's wife. i am not wont to be baffled in my enterprises, nor needs a norman noble scrupulously to vindicate his conduct to the saxon maiden whom he distinguishes by the offer of his hand. thou art proud, rowena, and thou art the fitter to be my wife. by what other means couldst thou be raised to high honour and to princely place, saving by my alliance . how else wouldst thou escape from the mean precincts of a country grange, where saxons herd with the swine which form their wealth, to take thy seat, honoured as thou shouldst be, and shalt be, amid all in england that is distinguished by beauty, or dignified by power . ". "sir knight," replied rowena, "the grange which you contemn hath been my shelter from infancy , and, trust me, when i leave it should that day ever arrive it shall be with one who has not learnt to despise the dwelling and manners in which i have been brought up.". "i guess your meaning, lady," said de bracy, "though you may think it lies too obscure for my apprehension. but dream not, that richard coeur de lion will ever resume his throne, far less that wilfred of ivanhoe, his minion, will ever lead thee to his footstool, to be there welcomed as the bride of a favourite. another suitor might feel jealousy while he touched this string , but my firm purpose cannot be changed by a passion so childish and so hopeless. know, lady, that this rival is in my power, and that it rests but with me to betray the secret of his being within the castle to front-de-boeuf, whose jealousy will be more fatal than mine.". "wilfred here . " said rowena, in disdain , "that is as true as that front-de-boeuf is his rival.". de bracy looked at her steadily for an instant. "wert thou really ignorant of this . " said he , "didst thou not know that wilfred of ivanhoe travelled in the litter of the jew . a meet conveyance for the crusader, whose doughty arm was to reconquer the holy sepulchre . " and he laughed scornfully. "and if he is here," said rowena, compelling herself to a tone of indifference, though trembling with an agony of apprehension which she could not suppress, "in what is he the rival of front-de-boeuf . or what has he to fear beyond a short imprisonment, and an honourable ransom, according to the use of chivalry . ". "rowena," said de bracy, "art thou, too, deceived by the common error of thy sex, who think there can be no rivalry but that respecting their own charms . knowest thou not there is a jealousy of ambition and of wealth, as well as of love , and that this our host, front-de-boeuf, will push from his road him who opposes his claim to the fair barony of ivanhoe, as readily, eagerly, and unscrupulously, as if he were preferred to him by some blue-eyed damsel . but smile on my suit, lady, and the wounded champion shall have nothing to fear from front-de-boeuf, whom else thou mayst mourn for, as in the hands of one who has never shown compassion.". "save him, for the love of heaven . " said rowena, her firmness giving way under terror for her lover's impending fate. "i can i will it is my purpose," said de bracy , "for, when rowena consents to be the bride of de bracy, who is it shall dare to put forth a violent hand upon her kinsman the son of her guardian the companion of her youth . but it is thy love must buy his protection. i am not romantic fool enough to further the fortune, or avert the fate, of one who is likely to be a successful obstacle between me and my wishes. use thine influence with me in his behalf, and he is safe, refuse to employ it, wilfred dies, and thou thyself art not the nearer to freedom.". "thy language," answered rowena, "hath in its indifferent bluntness something which cannot be reconciled with the horrors it seems to express. i believe not that thy purpose is so wicked, or thy power so great.". "flatter thyself, then, with that belief," said de bracy, "until time shall prove it false. thy lover lies wounded in this castle thy preferred lover. he is a bar betwixt front-de-boeuf and that which front-de-boeuf loves better than either ambition or beauty. what will it cost beyond the blow of a poniard, or the thrust of a javelin, to silence his opposition for ever . nay, were front-de-boeuf afraid to justify a deed so open, let the leech but give his patient a wrong draught let the chamberlain, or the nurse who tends him, but pluck the pillow from his head, and wilfred in his present condition, is sped without the effusion of blood. cedric also ". "and cedric also," said rowena, repeating his words , "my noble my generous guardian . i deserved the evil i have encountered, for forgetting his fate even in that of his son . ". "cedric's fate also depends upon thy determination," said de bracy , "and i leave thee to form it.". hitherto, rowena had sustained her part in this trying scene with undismayed courage, but it was because she had not considered the danger as serious and imminent. her disposition was naturally that which physiognomists consider as proper to fair complexions, mild, timid, and gentle , but it had been tempered, and, as it were, hardened, by the circumstances of her education. accustomed to see the will of all, even of cedric himself, sufficiently arbitrary with others, give way before her wishes, she had acquired that sort of courage and self-confidence which arises from the habitual and constant deference of the circle in which we move. she could scarce conceive the possibility of her will being opposed, far less that of its being treated with total disregard. her haughtiness and habit of domination was, therefore, a fictitious character, induced over that which was natural to her, and it deserted her when her eyes were opened to the extent of her own danger, as well as that of her lover and her guardian , and when she found her will, the slightest expression of which was wont to command respect and attention, now placed in opposition to that of a man of a strong, fierce, and determined mind, who possessed the advantage over her, and was resolved to use it, she quailed before him. after casting her eyes around, as if to look for the aid which was nowhere to be found, and after a few broken interjections, she raised her hands to heaven, and burst into a passion of uncontrolled vexation and sorrow. it was impossible to see so beautiful a creature in such extremity without feeling for her, and de bracy was not unmoved, though he was yet more embarrassed than touched. he had, in truth, gone too far to recede , and yet, in rowena's present condition, she could not be acted on either by argument or threats. he paced the apartment to and fro, now vainly exhorting the terrified maiden to compose herself, now hesitating concerning his own line of conduct. if, thought he, i should be moved by the tears and sorrow of this disconsolate damsel, what should i reap but the loss of these fair hopes for which i have encountered so much risk, and the ridicule of prince john and his jovial comrades . "and yet," he said to himself, "i feel myself ill framed for the part which i am playing. i cannot look on so fair a face while it is disturbed with agony, or on those eyes when they are drowned in tears. i would she had retained her original haughtiness of disposition, or that i had a larger share of front-de-boeuf's thrice-tempered hardness of heart . ". agitated by these thoughts, he could only bid the unfortunate rowena be comforted, and assure her, that as yet she had no reason for the excess of despair to which she was now giving way. but in this task of consolation de bracy was interrupted by the horn, "hoarse-winded blowing far and keen," which had at the same time alarmed the other inmates of the castle, and interrupted their several plans of avarice and of license. of them all, perhaps, de bracy least regretted the interruption , for his conference with the lady rowena had arrived at a point, where he found it equally difficult to prosecute or to resign his enterprise. and here we cannot but think it necessary to offer some better proof than the incidents of an idle tale, to vindicate the melancholy representation of manners which has been just laid before the reader. it is grievous to think that those valiant barons, to whose stand against the crown the liberties of england were indebted for their existence, should themselves have been such dreadful oppressors, and capable of excesses contrary not only to the laws of england, but to those of nature and humanity. but, alas . we have only to extract from the industrious henry one of those numerous passages which he has collected from contemporary historians, to prove that fiction itself can hardly reach the dark reality of the horrors of the period. the description given by the author of the saxon chronicle of the cruelties exercised in the reign of king stephen by the great barons and lords of castles, who were all normans, affords a strong proof of the excesses of which they were capable when their passions were inflamed. "they grievously oppressed the poor people by building castles , and when they were built, they filled them with wicked men, or rather devils, who seized both men and women who they imagined had any money, threw them into prison, and put them to more cruel tortures than the martyrs ever endured. they suffocated some in mud, and suspended others by the feet, or the head, or the thumbs, kindling fires below them. they squeezed the heads of some with knotted cords till they pierced their brains, while they threw others into dungeons swarming with serpents, snakes, and toads." but it would be cruel to put the reader to the pain of perusing the remainder of this description. . as another instance of these bitter fruits of conquest, and perhaps the strongest that can be quoted, we may mention, that the princess matilda, though a daughter of the king of scotland, and afterwards both queen of england, niece to edgar atheling, and mother to the empress of germany, the daughter, the wife, and the mother of monarchs, was obliged, during her early residence for education in england, to assume the veil of a nun, as the only means of escaping the licentious pursuit of the norman nobles.
