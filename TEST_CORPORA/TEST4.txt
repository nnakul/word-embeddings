finding himself overpowered, the jester at length threw himself from his horse, plunged into the thicket, and, favoured by the general confusion, escaped from the scene of action. yet the valiant jester, as soon as he found himself safe, hesitated more than once whether he should not turn back and share the captivity of a master to whom he was sincerely attached. "i have heard men talk of the blessings of freedom," he said to himself, "but i wish any wise man would teach me what use to make of it now that i have it.". as he pronounced these words aloud, a voice very near him called out in a low and cautious tone, "wamba . " and, at the same time, a dog, which he recognised to be fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. "gurth . " answered wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before him. "what is the matter . " said he eagerly , "what mean these cries, and that clashing of swords . ". "only a trick of the times," said wamba , "they are all prisoners.". "who are prisoners . " exclaimed gurth, impatiently. "my lord, and my lady, and athelstane, and hundibert, and oswald.". "in the name of god . " said gurth, "how came they prisoners . and to whom . ". "our master was too ready to fight," said the jester , "and athelstane was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. and they are prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. and they lie all tumbled about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your swine. and i would laugh at it," said the honest jester, "if i could for weeping." and he shed tears of unfeigned sorrow. gurth's countenance kindled "wamba," he said, "thou hast a weapon, and thy heart was ever stronger than thy brain, we are only two but a sudden attack from men of resolution will do much follow me . ". "whither . and for what purpose . " said the jester. "to rescue cedric.". "but you have renounced his service but now," said wamba. "that," said gurth, "was but while he was fortunate follow me . ". as the jester was about to obey, a third person suddenly made his appearance, and commanded them both to halt. from his dress and arms, wamba would have conjectured him to be one of those outlaws who had just assailed his master , but, besides that he wore no mask, the glittering baldric across his shoulder, with the rich bugle-horn which it supported, as well as the calm and commanding expression of his voice and manner, made him, notwithstanding the twilight, recognise locksley the yeoman, who had been victorious, under such disadvantageous circumstances, in the contest for the prize of archery. "what is the meaning of all this," said he, "or who is it that rifle, and ransom, and make prisoners, in these forests . ". "you may look at their cassocks close by," said wamba, "and see whether they be thy children's coats or no for they are as like thine own, as one green pea-cod is to another.". "i will learn that presently," answered locksley , "and i charge ye, on peril of your lives, not to stir from the place where ye stand, until i have returned. obey me, and it shall be the better for you and your masters. yet stay, i must render myself as like these men as possible.". so saying he unbuckled his baldric with the bugle, took a feather from his cap, and gave them to wamba , then drew a vizard from his pouch, and, repeating his charges to them to stand fast, went to execute his purposes of reconnoitring. "shall we stand fast, gurth . " said wamba , "or shall we e'en give him leg-bail . in my foolish mind, he had all the equipage of a thief too much in readiness, to be himself a true man.". "let him be the devil," said gurth, "an he will. we can be no worse of waiting his return. if he belong to that party, he must already have given them the alarm, and it will avail nothing either to fight or fly. besides, i have late experience, that errant thieves are not the worst men in the world to have to deal with.". the yeoman returned in the course of a few minutes. "friend gurth," he said, "i have mingled among yon men, and have learnt to whom they belong, and whither they are bound. there is, i think, no chance that they will proceed to any actual violence against their prisoners. for three men to attempt them at this moment, were little else than madness , for they are good men of war, and have, as such, placed sentinels to give the alarm when any one approaches. but i trust soon to gather such a force, as may act in defiance of all their precautions , you are both servants, and, as i think, faithful servants, of cedric the saxon, the friend of the rights of englishmen. he shall not want english hands to help him in this extremity. come then with me, until i gather more aid.". so saying, he walked through the wood at a great pace, followed by the jester and the swineherd. it was not consistent with wamba's humour to travel long in silence. "i think," said he, looking at the baldric and bugle which he still carried, "that i saw the arrow shot which won this gay prize, and that not so long since as christmas.". "and i," said gurth, "could take it on my halidome, that i have heard the voice of the good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day, and that the moon is not three days older since i did so.". "mine honest friends," replied the yeoman, "who, or what i am, is little to the present purpose , should i free your master, you will have reason to think me the best friend you have ever had in your lives. and whether i am known by one name or another or whether i can draw a bow as well or better than a cow-keeper, or whether it is my pleasure to walk in sunshine or by moonlight, are matters, which, as they do not concern you, so neither need ye busy yourselves respecting them.". "our heads are in the lion's mouth," said wamba, in a whisper to gurth, "get them out how we can.". "hush be silent," said gurth. "offend him not by thy folly, and i trust sincerely that all will go well.". chapter xx. when autumn nights were long and drear, and forest walks were dark and dim, how sweetly on the pilgrim's ear was wont to steal the hermit's hymn. devotion borrows music's tone, and music took devotion's wing , and, like the bird that hails the sun, they soar to heaven, and soaring sing. the hermit of st clement's well. it was after three hours' good walking that the servants of cedric, with their mysterious guide, arrived at a small opening in the forest, in the centre of which grew an oak-tree of enormous magnitude, throwing its twisted branches in every direction. beneath this tree four or five yeomen lay stretched on the ground, while another, as sentinel, walked to and fro in the moonlight shade. upon hearing the sound of feet approaching, the watch instantly gave the alarm, and the sleepers as suddenly started up and bent their bows. six arrows placed on the string were pointed towards the quarter from which the travellers approached, when their guide, being recognised, was welcomed with every token of respect and attachment, and all signs and fears of a rough reception at once subsided. "where is the miller . " was his first question. "on the road towards rotherham.". "with how many . " demanded the leader, for such he seemed to be. "with six men, and good hope of booty, if it please st nicholas.". "devoutly spoken," said locksley , "and where is allan-a-dale . ". "walked up towards the watling-street, to watch for the prior of jorvaulx.". "that is well thought on also," replied the captain , "and where is the friar . ". "in his cell.". "thither will i go," said locksley. "disperse and seek your companions. collect what force you can, for there's game afoot that must be hunted hard, and will turn to bay. meet me here by daybreak. and stay," he added, "i have forgotten what is most necessary of the whole two of you take the road quickly towards torquilstone, the castle of front-de-boeuf. a set of gallants, who have been masquerading in such guise as our own, are carrying a band of prisoners thither watch them closely, for even if they reach the castle before we collect our force, our honour is concerned to punish them, and we will find means to do so. keep a close watch on them therefore , and dispatch one of your comrades, the lightest of foot, to bring the news of the yeomen thereabout.". they promised implicit obedience, and departed with alacrity on their different errands. in the meanwhile, their leader and his two companions, who now looked upon him with great respect, as well as some fear, pursued their way to the chapel of copmanhurst. when they had reached the little moonlight glade, having in front the reverend, though ruinous chapel, and the rude hermitage, so well suited to ascetic devotion, wamba whispered to gurth, "if this be the habitation of a thief, it makes good the old proverb, the nearer the church the farther from god. and by my coxcomb," he added, "i think it be even so hearken but to the black sanctus which they are singing in the hermitage . ". in fact the anchorite and his guest were performing, at the full extent of their very powerful lungs, an old drinking song, of which this was the burden . "come, trowl the brown bowl to me, bully boy, bully boy, come, trowl the brown bowl to me ho . jolly jenkin, i spy a knave in drinking, come, trowl the brown bowl to me.". "now, that is not ill sung," said wamba, who had thrown in a few of his own flourishes to help out the chorus. "but who, in the saint's name, ever expected to have heard such a jolly chant come from out a hermit's cell at midnight . ". "marry, that should i," said gurth, "for the jolly clerk of copmanhurst is a known man, and kills half the deer that are stolen in this walk. men say that the keeper has complained to his official, and that he will be stripped of his cowl and cope altogether, if he keeps not better order.". while they were thus speaking, locksley's loud and repeated knocks had at length disturbed the anchorite and his guest. "by my beads," said the hermit, stopping short in a grand flourish, "here come more benighted guests. i would not for my cowl that they found us in this goodly exercise. all men have their enemies, good sir sluggard , and there be those malignant enough to construe the hospitable refreshment which i have been offering to you, a weary traveller, for the matter of three short hours, into sheer drunkenness and debauchery, vices alike alien to my profession and my disposition.". "base calumniators . " replied the knight , "i would i had the chastising of them. nevertheless, holy clerk, it is true that all have their enemies , and there be those in this very land whom i would rather speak to through the bars of my helmet than barefaced.". "get thine iron pot on thy head then, friend sluggard, as quickly as thy nature will permit," said the hermit, "while i remove these pewter flagons, whose late contents run strangely in mine own pate , and to drown the clatter for, in faith, i feel somewhat unsteady strike into the tune which thou hearest me sing , it is no matter for the words i scarce know them myself.". so saying, he struck up a thundering "de profundis clamavi", under cover of which he removed the apparatus of their banquet while the knight, laughing heartily, and arming himself all the while, assisted his host with his voice from time to time as his mirth permitted. "what devil's matins are you after at this hour . " said a voice from without. "heaven forgive you, sir traveller . " said the hermit, whose own noise, and perhaps his nocturnal potations, prevented from recognising accents which were tolerably familiar to him "wend on your way, in the name of god and saint dunstan, and disturb not the devotions of me and my holy brother.". "mad priest," answered the voice from without, "open to locksley . ". "all's safe all's right," said the hermit to his companion. "but who is he . " said the black knight , "it imports me much to know.". "who is he . " answered the hermit , "i tell thee he is a friend.". "but what friend . " answered the knight , "for he may be friend to thee and none of mine . ". "what friend . " replied the hermit , "that, now, is one of the questions that is more easily asked than answered. what friend . why, he is, now that i bethink me a little, the very same honest keeper i told thee of a while since.". "ay, as honest a keeper as thou art a pious hermit," replied the knight, "i doubt it not. but undo the door to him before he beat it from its hinges.". the dogs, in the meantime, which had made a dreadful baying at the commencement of the disturbance, seemed now to recognise the voice of him who stood without , for, totally changing their manner, they scratched and whined at the door, as if interceding for his admission. the hermit speedily unbolted his portal, and admitted locksley, with his two companions. "why, hermit," was the yeoman's first question as soon as he beheld the knight, "what boon companion hast thou here . ". "a brother of our order," replied the friar, shaking his head , "we have been at our orisons all night.". "he is a monk of the church militant, i think," answered locksley , "and there be more of them abroad. i tell thee, friar, thou must lay down the rosary and take up the quarter-staff , we shall need every one of our merry men, whether clerk or layman. but," he added, taking him a step aside, "art thou mad . to give admittance to a knight thou dost not know . hast thou forgot our articles . ". "not know him . " replied the friar, boldly, "i know him as well as the beggar knows his dish.". "and what is his name, then . " demanded locksley. "his name," said the hermit "his name is sir anthony of scrabelstone as if i would drink with a man, and did not know his name . ". "thou hast been drinking more than enough, friar," said the woodsman, "and, i fear, prating more than enough too.". "good yeoman," said the knight, coming forward, "be not wroth with my merry host. he did but afford me the hospitality which i would have compelled from him if he had refused it.". "thou compel . " said the friar , "wait but till have changed this grey gown for a green cassock, and if i make not a quarter-staff ring twelve upon thy pate, i am neither true clerk nor good woodsman.". while he spoke thus, he stript off his gown, and appeared in a close black buckram doublet and drawers, over which he speedily did on a cassock of green, and hose of the same colour. "i pray thee truss my points," said he to wamba, "and thou shalt have a cup of sack for thy labour.". "gramercy for thy sack," said wamba , "but think'st thou it is lawful for me to aid you to transmew thyself from a holy hermit into a sinful forester . ". "never fear," said the hermit , "i will but confess the sins of my green cloak to my greyfriar's frock, and all shall be well again.". "amen . " answered the jester , "a broadcloth penitent should have a sackcloth confessor, and your frock may absolve my motley doublet into the bargain.". so saying, he accommodated the friar with his assistance in tying the endless number of points, as the laces which attached the hose to the doublet were then termed. while they were thus employed, locksley led the knight a little apart, and addressed him thus "deny it not, sir knight you are he who decided the victory to the advantage of the english against the strangers on the second day of the tournament at ashby.". "and what follows if you guess truly, good yeoman . " replied the knight. "i should in that case hold you," replied the yeoman, "a friend to the weaker party.". "such is the duty of a true knight at least," replied the black champion , "and i would not willingly that there were reason to think otherwise of me.". "but for my purpose," said the yeoman, "thou shouldst be as well a good englishman as a good knight , for that, which i have to speak of, concerns, indeed, the duty of every honest man, but is more especially that of a true-born native of england.". "you can speak to no one," replied the knight, "to whom england, and the life of every englishman, can be dearer than to me.". "i would willingly believe so," said the woodsman, "for never had this country such need to be supported by those who love her. hear me, and i will tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou be'st really that which thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourable part. a band of villains, in the disguise of better men than themselves, have made themselves master of the person of a noble englishman, called cedric the saxon, together with his ward, and his friend athelstane of coningsburgh, and have transported them to a castle in this forest, called torquilstone. i ask of thee, as a good knight and a good englishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue . ". "i am bound by my vow to do so," replied the knight , "but i would willingly know who you are, who request my assistance in their behalf . ". "i am," said the forester, "a nameless man , but i am the friend of my country, and of my country's friends with this account of me you must for the present remain satisfied, the more especially since you yourself desire to continue unknown. believe, however, that my word, when pledged, is as inviolate as if i wore golden spurs.". "i willingly believe it," said the knight , "i have been accustomed to study men's countenances, and i can read in thine honesty and resolution. i will, therefore, ask thee no further questions, but aid thee in setting at freedom these oppressed captives , which done, i trust we shall part better acquainted, and well satisfied with each other.". "so," said wamba to gurth, for the friar being now fully equipped, the jester, having approached to the other side of the hut, had heard the conclusion of the conversation, "so we have got a new ally . l trust the valour of the knight will be truer metal than the religion of the hermit, or the honesty of the yeoman , for this locksley looks like a born deer-stealer, and the priest like a lusty hypocrite.". "hold thy peace, wamba," said gurth , "it may all be as thou dost guess , but were the horned devil to rise and proffer me his assistance to set at liberty cedric and the lady rowena, i fear i should hardly have religion enough to refuse the foul fiend's offer, and bid him get behind me.". the friar was now completely accoutred as a yeoman, with sword and buckler, bow, and quiver, and a strong partisan over his shoulder. he left his cell at the head of the party, and, having carefully locked the door, deposited the key under the threshold. "art thou in condition to do good service, friar," said locksley, "or does the brown bowl still run in thy head . ". "not more than a drought of st dunstan's fountain will allay," answered the priest , "something there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of instability in my legs, but you shall presently see both pass away.". so saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of the fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white moonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the spring. "when didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, holy clerk of copmanhurst . " said the black knight. "never since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal vent," replied the friar, "and so left me nothing to drink but my patron's bounty here.". then plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them all marks of the midnight revel. thus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan round his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed, exclaiming at the same time, "where be those false ravishers, who carry off wenches against their will . may the foul fiend fly off with me, if i am not man enough for a dozen of them.". "swearest thou, holy clerk . " said the black knight. "clerk me no clerks," replied the transformed priest , "by saint george and the dragon, i am no longer a shaveling than while my frock is on my back when i am cased in my green cassock, i will drink, swear, and woo a lass, with any blithe forester in the west riding.". "come on, jack priest," said locksley, "and be silent , thou art as noisy as a whole convent on a holy eve, when the father abbot has gone to bed. come on you, too, my masters, tarry not to talk of it i say, come on, we must collect all our forces, and few enough we shall have, if we are to storm the castle of reginald front-de-boeuf.". "what . is it front-de-boeuf," said the black knight, "who has stopt on the king's highway the king's liege subjects . is he turned thief and oppressor . ". "oppressor he ever was," said locksley. "and for thief," said the priest, "i doubt if ever he were even half so honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.". "move on, priest, and be silent," said the yeoman , "it were better you led the way to the place of rendezvous, than say what should be left unsaid, both in decency and prudence.". chapter xxi. alas, how many hours and years have past, since human forms have round this table sate, or lamp, or taper, on its surface gleam'd . methinks, i hear the sound of time long pass'd still murmuring o'er us, in the lofty void of these dark arches, like the ling'ring voices of those who long within their graves have slept. orra, a tragedy. while these measures were taking in behalf of cedric and his companions, the armed men by whom the latter had been seized, hurried their captives along towards the place of security, where they intended to imprison them. but darkness came on fast, and the paths of the wood seemed but imperfectly known to the marauders. they were compelled to make several long halts, and once or twice to return on their road to resume the direction which they wished to pursue. the summer morn had dawned upon them ere they could travel in full assurance that they held the right path. but confidence returned with light, and the cavalcade now moved rapidly forward. meanwhile, the following dialogue took place between the two leaders of the banditti. "it is time thou shouldst leave us, sir maurice," said the templar to de bracy, "in order to prepare the second part of thy mystery. thou art next, thou knowest, to act the knight deliverer.". "i have thought better of it," said de bracy , "i will not leave thee till the prize is fairly deposited in front-de-boeuf's castle. there will i appear before the lady rowena in mine own shape, and trust that she will set down to the vehemence of my passion the violence of which i have been guilty.". "and what has made thee change thy plan, de bracy . " replied the knight templar. "that concerns thee nothing," answered his companion. "i would hope, however, sir knight," said the templar, "that this alteration of measures arises from no suspicion of my honourable meaning, such as fitzurse endeavoured to instil into thee . ". "my thoughts are my own," answered de bracy , "the fiend laughs, they say, when one thief robs another , and we know, that were he to spit fire and brimstone instead, it would never prevent a templar from following his bent.". "or the leader of a free company," answered the templar, "from dreading at the hands of a comrade and friend, the injustice he does to all mankind.". "this is unprofitable and perilous recrimination," answered de bracy , "suffice it to say, i know the morals of the temple-order, and i will not give thee the power of cheating me out of the fair prey for which i have run such risks.". "psha," replied the templar, "what hast thou to fear . thou knowest the vows of our order.". "right well," said de bracy, "and also how they are kept. come, sir templar, the laws of gallantry have a liberal interpretation in palestine, and this is a case in which i will trust nothing to your conscience.". "hear the truth, then," said the templar , "i care not for your blue-eyed beauty. there is in that train one who will make me a better mate.". "what . wouldst thou stoop to the waiting damsel . " said de bracy. "no, sir knight," said the templar, haughtily. "to the waiting-woman will i not stoop. i have a prize among the captives as lovely as thine own.". "by the mass, thou meanest the fair jewess . " said de bracy. "and if i do," said bois-guilbert, "who shall gainsay me . ". "no one that i know," said de bracy, "unless it be your vow of celibacy, or a check of conscience for an intrigue with a jewess.". "for my vow," said the templar, "our grand master hath granted me a dispensation. and for my conscience, a man that has slain three hundred saracens, need not reckon up every little failing, like a village girl at her first confession upon good friday eve.". "thou knowest best thine own privileges," said de bracy. "yet, i would have sworn thy thought had been more on the old usurer's money bags, than on the black eyes of the daughter.". "i can admire both," answered the templar , "besides, the old jew is but half-prize. i must share his spoils with front-de-boeuf, who will not lend us the use of his castle for nothing. i must have something that i can term exclusively my own by this foray of ours, and i have fixed on the lovely jewess as my peculiar prize. but, now thou knowest my drift, thou wilt resume thine own original plan, wilt thou not . thou hast nothing, thou seest, to fear from my interference.". "no," replied de bracy, "i will remain beside my prize. what thou sayst is passing true, but i like not the privileges acquired by the dispensation of the grand master, and the merit acquired by the slaughter of three hundred saracens. you have too good a right to a free pardon, to render you very scrupulous about peccadilloes.". while this dialogue was proceeding, cedric was endeavouring to wring out of those who guarded him an avowal of their character and purpose. "you should be englishmen," said he , "and yet, sacred heaven . you prey upon your countrymen as if you were very normans. you should be my neighbours, and, if so, my friends , for which of my english neighbours have reason to be otherwise . i tell ye, yeomen, that even those among ye who have been branded with outlawry have had from me protection , for i have pitied their miseries, and curst the oppression of their tyrannic nobles. what, then, would you have of me . or in what can this violence serve ye . ye are worse than brute beasts in your actions, and will you imitate them in their very dumbness . ". it was in vain that cedric expostulated with his guards, who had too many good reasons for their silence to be induced to break it either by his wrath or his expostulations. they continued to hurry him along, travelling at a very rapid rate, until, at the end of an avenue of huge trees, arose torquilstone, now the hoary and ancient castle of reginald front-de-boeuf. it was a fortress of no great size, consisting of a donjon, or large and high square tower, surrounded by buildings of inferior height, which were encircled by an inner court-yard. around the exterior wall was a deep moat, supplied with water from a neighbouring rivulet. front-de-boeuf, whose character placed him often at feud with his enemies, had made considerable additions to the strength of his castle, by building towers upon the outward wall, so as to flank it at every angle. the access, as usual in castles of the period, lay through an arched barbican, or outwork, which was terminated and defended by a small turret at each corner. cedric no sooner saw the turrets of front-de-boeuf's castle raise their grey and moss-grown battlements, glimmering in the morning sun above the wood by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more truly concerning the cause of his misfortune. "i did injustice," he said, "to the thieves and outlaws of these woods, when i supposed such banditti to belong to their bands , i might as justly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening wolves of france. tell me, dogs is it my life or my wealth that your master aims at . is it too much that two saxons, myself and the noble athelstane, should hold land in the country which was once the patrimony of our race . put us then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking our lives, as you began with our liberties. if the saxon cedric cannot rescue england, he is willing to die for her. tell your tyrannical master, i do only beseech him to dismiss the lady rowena in honour and safety. she is a woman, and he need not dread her , and with us will die all who dare fight in her cause.". the attendants remained as mute to this address as to the former, and they now stood before the gate of the castle. de bracy winded his horn three times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall upon seeing their approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit them. the prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were conducted to an apartment where a hasty repast was offered them, of which none but athelstane felt any inclination to partake. neither had the descendant of the confessor much time to do justice to the good cheer placed before them, for their guards gave him and cedric to understand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from rowena. resistance was vain , and they were compelled to follow to a large room, which, rising on clumsy saxon pillars, resembled those refectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most ancient parts of our most ancient monasteries. the lady rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with courtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to a distant apartment. the same alarming distinction was conferred on rebecca, in spite of her father's entreaties, who offered even money, in this extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide with him. "base unbeliever," answered one of his guards, "when thou hast seen thy lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it." and, without farther discussion, the old jew was forcibly dragged off in a different direction from the other prisoners. the domestics, after being carefully searched and disarmed, were confined in another part of the castle , and rowena was refused even the comfort she might have derived from the attendance of her handmaiden elgitha.
