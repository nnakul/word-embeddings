this excuse she stated before a great council of the clergy of england, as the sole reason for her having taken the religious habit. the assembled clergy admitted the validity of the plea, and the notoriety of the circumstances upon which it was founded , giving thus an indubitable and most remarkable testimony to the existence of that disgraceful license by which that age was stained. it was a matter of public knowledge, they said, that after the conquest of king william, his norman followers, elated by so great a victory, acknowledged no law but their own wicked pleasure, and not only despoiled the conquered saxons of their lands and their goods, but invaded the honour of their wives and of their daughters with the most unbridled license , and hence it was then common for matrons and maidens of noble families to assume the veil, and take shelter in convents, not as called thither by the vocation of god, but solely to preserve their honour from the unbridled wickedness of man. such and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public declaration of the assembled clergy, recorded by eadmer , and we need add nothing more to vindicate the probability of the scenes which we have detailed, and are about to detail, upon the more apocryphal authority of the wardour ms. chapter xxiv. i'll woo her as the lion woos his bride. douglas. while the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the castle, the jewess rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered turret. hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers, and on being thrust into the little cell, she found herself in the presence of an old sibyl, who kept murmuring to herself a saxon rhyme, as if to beat time to the revolving dance which her spindle was performing upon the floor. the hag raised her head as rebecca entered, and scowled at the fair jewess with the malignant envy with which old age and ugliness, when united with evil conditions, are apt to look upon youth and beauty. "thou must up and away, old house-cricket," said one of the men , "our noble master commands it thou must e'en leave this chamber to a fairer guest.". "ay," grumbled the hag, "even thus is service requited. i have known when my bare word would have cast the best man-at-arms among ye out of saddle and out of service , and now must i up and away at the command of every groom such as thou.". "good dame urfried," said the other man, "stand not to reason on it, but up and away. lords' hests must be listened to with a quick ear. thou hast had thy day, old dame, but thy sun has long been set. thou art now the very emblem of an old war-horse turned out on the barren heath thou hast had thy paces in thy time, but now a broken amble is the best of them come, amble off with thee.". "ill omens dog ye both . " said the old woman , "and a kennel be your burying-place . may the evil demon zernebock tear me limb from limb, if i leave my own cell ere i have spun out the hemp on my distaff . ". "answer it to our lord, then, old housefiend," said the man, and retired , leaving rebecca in company with the old woman, upon whose presence she had been thus unwillingly forced. "what devil's deed have they now in the wind . " said the old hag, murmuring to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelong and malignant glance at rebecca , "but it is easy to guess bright eyes, black locks, and a skin like paper, ere the priest stains it with his black unguent ay, it is easy to guess why they send her to this lone turret, whence a shriek could no more be heard than at the depth of five hundred fathoms beneath the earth. thou wilt have owls for thy neighbours, fair one , and their screams will be heard as far, and as much regarded, as thine own. outlandish, too," she said, marking the dress and turban of rebecca "what country art thou of . a saracen . or an egyptian . why dost not answer . thou canst weep, canst thou not speak . ". "be not angry, good mother," said rebecca. "thou needst say no more," replied urfried "men know a fox by the train, and a jewess by her tongue.". "for the sake of mercy," said rebecca, "tell me what i am to expect as the conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither . is it my life they seek, to atone for my religion . i will lay it down cheerfully.". "thy life, minion . " answered the sibyl , "what would taking thy life pleasure them . trust me, thy life is in no peril. such usage shalt thou have as was once thought good enough for a noble saxon maiden. and shall a jewess, like thee, repine because she hath no better . look at me i was as young and twice as fair as thou, when front-de-boeuf, father of this reginald, and his normans, stormed this castle. my father and his seven sons defended their inheritance from story to story, from chamber to chamber there was not a room, not a step of the stair, that was not slippery with their blood. they died they died every man , and ere their bodies were cold, and ere their blood was dried, i had become the prey and the scorn of the conqueror . ". "is there no help . are there no means of escape . " said rebecca "richly, richly would i requite thine aid.". "think not of it," said the hag , "from hence there is no escape but through the gates of death , and it is late, late," she added, shaking her grey head, "ere these open to us yet it is comfort to think that we leave behind us on earth those who shall be wretched as ourselves. fare thee well, jewess . jew or gentile, thy fate would be the same , for thou hast to do with them that have neither scruple nor pity. fare thee well, i say. my thread is spun out thy task is yet to begin.". "stay . stay . for heaven's sake . " said rebecca , "stay, though it be to curse and to revile me thy presence is yet some protection.". "the presence of the mother of god were no protection," answered the old woman. "there she stands," pointing to a rude image of the virgin mary, "see if she can avert the fate that awaits thee.". she left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of sneering laugh, which made them seem even more hideous than their habitual frown. she locked the door behind her, and rebecca might hear her curse every step for its steepness, as slowly and with difficulty she descended the turret-stair. rebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of rowena , for what probability was there that either softness or ceremony would be used towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might be preserved towards a saxon heiress . yet had the jewess this advantage, that she was better prepared by habits of thought, and by natural strength of mind, to encounter the dangers to which she was exposed. of a strong and observing character, even from her earliest years, the pomp and wealth which her father displayed within his walls, or which she witnessed in the houses of other wealthy hebrews, had not been able to blind her to the precarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed. like damocles at his celebrated banquet, rebecca perpetually beheld, amid that gorgeous display, the sword which was suspended over the heads of her people by a single hair. these reflections had tamed and brought down to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper, which, under other circumstances, might have waxed haughty, supercilious, and obstinate. from her father's example and injunctions, rebecca had learnt to bear herself courteously towards all who approached her. she could not indeed imitate his excess of subservience, because she was a stranger to the meanness of mind, and to the constant state of timid apprehension, by which it was dictated , but she bore herself with a proud humility, as if submitting to the evil circumstances in which she was placed as the daughter of a despised race, while she felt in her mind the consciousness that she was entitled to hold a higher rank from her merit, than the arbitrary despotism of religious prejudice permitted her to aspire to. thus prepared to expect adverse circumstances, she had acquired the firmness necessary for acting under them. her present situation required all her presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly. her first care was to inspect the apartment , but it afforded few hopes either of escape or protection. it contained neither secret passage nor trap-door, and unless where the door by which she had entered joined the main building, seemed to be circumscribed by the round exterior wall of the turret. the door had no inside bolt or bar. the single window opened upon an embattled space surmounting the turret, which gave rebecca, at first sight, some hopes of escaping , but she soon found it had no communication with any other part of the battlements, being an isolated bartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a parapet, with embrasures, at which a few archers might be stationed for defending the turret, and flanking with their shot the wall of the castle on that side. there was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that strong reliance on heaven natural to great and generous characters. rebecca, however erroneously taught to interpret the promises of scripture to the chosen people of heaven, did not err in supposing the present to be their hour of trial, or in trusting that the children of zion would be one day called in with the fulness of the gentiles. in the meanwhile, all around her showed that their present state was that of punishment and probation, and that it was their especial duty to suffer without sinning. thus prepared to consider herself as the victim of misfortune, rebecca had early reflected upon her own state, and schooled her mind to meet the dangers which she had probably to encounter. the prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was heard on the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowly opened, and a tall man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed their misfortune, slowly entered, and shut the door behind him , his cap, pulled down upon his brows, concealed the upper part of his face, and he held his mantle in such a manner as to muffle the rest. in this guise, as if prepared for the execution of some deed, at the thought of which he was himself ashamed, he stood before the affrighted prisoner , yet, ruffian as his dress bespoke him, he seemed at a loss to express what purpose had brought him thither, so that rebecca, making an effort upon herself, had time to anticipate his explanation. she had already unclasped two costly bracelets and a collar, which she hastened to proffer to the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally that to gratify his avarice was to bespeak his favour. "take these," she said, "good friend, and for god's sake be merciful to me and my aged father . these ornaments are of value, yet are they trifling to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this castle, free and uninjured.". "fair flower of palestine," replied the outlaw, "these pearls are orient, but they yield in whiteness to your teeth , the diamonds are brilliant, but they cannot match your eyes , and ever since i have taken up this wild trade, i have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth.". "do not do yourself such wrong," said rebecca , "take ransom, and have mercy . gold will purchase you pleasure, to misuse us, could only bring thee remorse. my father will willingly satiate thy utmost wishes , and if thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchase with our spoils thy restoration to civil society mayst obtain pardon for past errors, and be placed beyond the necessity of committing more.". "it is well spoken," replied the outlaw in french, finding it difficult probably to sustain, in saxon, a conversation which rebecca had opened in that language , "but know, bright lily of the vale of baca . that thy father is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist, who knows how to convert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate. the venerable isaac is subjected to an alembic, which will distil from him all he holds dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy entreaty. the ransom must be paid by love and beauty, and in no other coin will i accept it.". "thou art no outlaw," said rebecca, in the same language in which he addressed her , "no outlaw had refused such offers. no outlaw in this land uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. thou art no outlaw, but a norman a norman, noble perhaps in birth o, be so in thy actions, and cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence . ". i will soon return, and hold further conference with thee.". he re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving rebecca scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which she had been so lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the bold bad man in whose power she found herself so unhappily placed. when she entered the turret-chamber, her first duty was to return thanks to the god of jacob for the protection which he had afforded her, and to implore its continuance for her and for her father. another name glided into her petition it was that of the wounded christian, whom fate had placed in the hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed enemies. her heart indeed checked her, as if, even in communing with the deity in prayer, she mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate hers could have no alliance a nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. but the petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices of her sect induce rebecca to wish it recalled. chapter xxv. a damn'd cramp piece of penmanship as ever i saw in my life . she stoops to conquer. when the templar reached the hall of the castle, he found de bracy already there. "your love-suit," said de bracy, "hath, i suppose, been disturbed, like mine, by this obstreperous summons. but you have come later and more reluctantly, and therefore i presume your interview has proved more agreeable than mine.". "has your suit, then, been unsuccessfully paid to the saxon heiress . " said the templar. "by the bones of thomas a becket," answered de bracy, "the lady rowena must have heard that i cannot endure the sight of women's tears.". "away . " said the templar , "thou a leader of a free company, and regard a woman's tears . a few drops sprinkled on the torch of love, make the flame blaze the brighter.". "gramercy for the few drops of thy sprinkling," replied de bracy , "but this damsel hath wept enough to extinguish a beacon-light. never was such wringing of hands and such overflowing of eyes, since the days of st niobe, of whom prior aymer told us. . a water-fiend hath possessed the fair saxon.". "a legion of fiends have occupied the bosom of the jewess," replied the templar , "for, i think no single one, not even apollyon himself, could have inspired such indomitable pride and resolution. but where is front-de-boeuf . that horn is sounded more and more clamorously.". "he is negotiating with the jew, i suppose," replied de bracy, coolly , "probably the howls of isaac have drowned the blast of the bugle. thou mayst know, by experience, sir brian, that a jew parting with his treasures on such terms as our friend front-de-boeuf is like to offer, will raise a clamour loud enough to be heard over twenty horns and trumpets to boot. but we will make the vassals call him.". they were soon after joined by front-de-boeuf, who had been disturbed in his tyrannic cruelty in the manner with which the reader is acquainted, and had only tarried to give some necessary directions. "let us see the cause of this cursed clamour," said front-de-boeuf "here is a letter, and, if i mistake not, it is in saxon.". he looked at it, turning it round and round as if he had had really some hopes of coming at the meaning by inverting the position of the paper, and then handed it to de bracy. "it may be magic spells for aught i know," said de bracy, who possessed his full proportion of the ignorance which characterised the chivalry of the period. "our chaplain attempted to teach me to write," he said, "but all my letters were formed like spear-heads and sword-blades, and so the old shaveling gave up the task.". "give it me," said the templar. "we have that of the priestly character, that we have some knowledge to enlighten our valour.". "let us profit by your most reverend knowledge, then," said de bracy , "what says the scroll . ". "it is a formal letter of defiance," answered the templar , "but, by our lady of bethlehem, if it be not a foolish jest, it is the most extraordinary cartel that ever was sent across the drawbridge of a baronial castle.". "jest . " said front-de-boeuf, "i would gladly know who dares jest with me in such a matter . read it, sir brian.". the templar accordingly read it as follows "i, wamba, the son of witless, jester to a noble and free-born man, cedric of rotherwood, called the saxon, and i, gurth, the son of beowulph, the swineherd -". "thou art mad," said front-de-boeuf, interrupting the reader. "by st luke, it is so set down," answered the templar. then resuming his task, he went on, "i, gurth, the son of beowulph, swineherd unto the said cedric, with the assistance of our allies and confederates, who make common cause with us in this our feud, namely, the good knight, called for the present 'le noir faineant', and the stout yeoman, robert locksley, called cleave-the-wand. do you, reginald front de-boeuf, and your allies and accomplices whomsoever, to wit, that whereas you have, without cause given or feud declared, wrongfully and by mastery seized upon the person of our lord and master the said cedric , also upon the person of a noble and freeborn damsel, the lady rowena of hargottstandstede , also upon the person of a noble and freeborn man, athelstane of coningsburgh , also upon the persons of certain freeborn men, their 'cnichts' , also upon certain serfs, their born bondsmen , also upon a certain jew, named isaac of york, together with his daughter, a jewess, and certain horses and mules which noble persons, with their 'cnichts' and slaves, and also with the horses and mules, jew and jewess beforesaid, were all in peace with his majesty, and travelling as liege subjects upon the king's highway , therefore we require and demand that the said noble persons, namely, cedric of rotherwood, rowena of hargottstandstede, athelstane of coningsburgh, with their servants, 'cnichts', and followers, also the horses and mules, jew and jewess aforesaid, together with all goods and chattels to them pertaining, be, within an hour after the delivery hereof, delivered to us, or to those whom we shall appoint to receive the same, and that untouched and unharmed in body and goods. failing of which, we do pronounce to you, that we hold ye as robbers and traitors, and will wager our bodies against ye in battle, siege, or otherwise, and do our utmost to your annoyance and destruction. wherefore may god have you in his keeping. signed by us upon the eve of st withold's day, under the great trysting oak in the hart-hill walk, the above being written by a holy man, clerk to god, our lady, and st dunstan, in the chapel of copmanhurst.". at the bottom of this document was scrawled, in the first place, a rude sketch of a cock's head and comb, with a legend expressing this hieroglyphic to be the sign-manual of wamba, son of witless. under this respectable emblem stood a cross, stated to be the mark of gurth, the son of beowulph. then was written, in rough bold characters, the words, "le noir faineant". and, to conclude the whole, an arrow, neatly enough drawn, was described as the mark of the yeoman locksley. the knights heard this uncommon document read from end to end, and then gazed upon each other in silent amazement, as being utterly at a loss to know what it could portend. de bracy was the first to break silence by an uncontrollable fit of laughter, wherein he was joined, though with more moderation, by the templar. front-de-boeuf, on the contrary, seemed impatient of their ill-timed jocularity. "i give you plain warning," he said, "fair sirs, that you had better consult how to bear yourselves under these circumstances, than give way to such misplaced merriment.". "front-de-boeuf has not recovered his temper since his late overthrow," said de bracy to the templar , "he is cowed at the very idea of a cartel, though it come but from a fool and a swineherd.". "by st michael," answered front-de-boeuf, "i would thou couldst stand the whole brunt of this adventure thyself, de bracy. these fellows dared not have acted with such inconceivable impudence, had they not been supported by some strong bands. there are enough of outlaws in this forest to resent my protecting the deer. i did but tie one fellow, who was taken redhanded and in the fact, to the horns of a wild stag, which gored him to death in five minutes, and i had as many arrows shot at me as there were launched against yonder target at ashby. here, fellow," he added, to one of his attendants, "hast thou sent out to see by what force this precious challenge is to be supported . ". "there are at least two hundred men assembled in the woods," answered a squire who was in attendance. "here is a proper matter . " said front-de-boeuf, "this comes of lending you the use of my castle, that cannot manage your undertaking quietly, but you must bring this nest of hornets about my ears . ". "of hornets . " said de bracy , "of stingless drones rather , a band of lazy knaves, who take to the wood, and destroy the venison rather than labour for their maintenance.". "stingless . " replied front-de-boeuf , "fork-headed shafts of a cloth-yard in length, and these shot within the breadth of a french crown, are sting enough.". "for shame, sir knight . " said the templar. "let us summon our people, and sally forth upon them. one knight ay, one man-at-arms, were enough for twenty such peasants.". "enough, and too much," said de bracy , "i should only be ashamed to couch lance against them.". "true," answered front-de-boeuf , "were they black turks or moors, sir templar, or the craven peasants of france, most valiant de bracy , but these are english yeomen, over whom we shall have no advantage, save what we may derive from our arms and horses, which will avail us little in the glades of the forest. sally, saidst thou . we have scarce men enough to defend the castle. the best of mine are at york , so is all your band, de bracy , and we have scarcely twenty, besides the handful that were engaged in this mad business.". "thou dost not fear," said the templar, "that they can assemble in force sufficient to attempt the castle . ". "not so, sir brian," answered front-de-boeuf. "these outlaws have indeed a daring captain , but without machines, scaling ladders, and experienced leaders, my castle may defy them.". "send to thy neighbours," said the templar, "let them assemble their people, and come to the rescue of three knights, besieged by a jester and a swineherd in the baronial castle of reginald front-de-boeuf . ". "you jest, sir knight," answered the baron , "but to whom should i send . malvoisin is by this time at york with his retainers, and so are my other allies , and so should i have been, but for this infernal enterprise.". "then send to york, and recall our people," said de bracy. "if they abide the shaking of my standard, or the sight of my free companions, i will give them credit for the boldest outlaws ever bent bow in green-wood.". "and who shall bear such a message . " said front-de-boeuf , "they will beset every path, and rip the errand out of his bosom. i have it," he added, after pausing for a moment "sir templar, thou canst write as well as read, and if we can but find the writing materials of my chaplain, who died a twelvemonth since in the midst of his christmas carousals ". "so please ye," said the squire, who was still in attendance, "i think old urfried has them somewhere in keeping, for love of the confessor. he was the last man, i have heard her tell, who ever said aught to her, which man ought in courtesy to address to maid or matron.". "go, search them out, engelred," said front-de-boeuf , "and then, sir templar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.". "i would rather do it at the sword's point than at that of the pen," said bois-guilbert , "but be it as you will.". he sat down accordingly, and indited, in the french language, an epistle of the following tenor "sir reginald front-de-boeuf, with his noble and knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the hands of slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. if the person calling himself the black knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought to know that he stands degraded by his present association, and has no right to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood. touching the prisoners we have made, we do in christian charity require you to send a man of religion, to receive their confession, and reconcile them with god , since it is our fixed intention to execute them this morning before noon, so that their heads being placed on the battlements, shall show to all men how lightly we esteem those who have bestirred themselves in their rescue. wherefore, as above, we require you to send a priest to reconcile them to god, in doing which you shall render them the last earthly service.". this letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to the messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had brought. the yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the head-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established under a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the castle. here wamba and gurth, with their allies the black knight and locksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to their summons. around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed the ordinary nature of their occupation. more than two hundred had already assembled, and others were fast coming in. those whom they obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather in the cap, their dress, arms, and equipments being in all other respects the same. besides these bands, a less orderly and a worse armed force, consisting of the saxon inhabitants of the neighbouring township, as well as many bondsmen and servants from cedric's extensive estate, had already arrived, for the purpose of assisting in his rescue. few of these were armed otherwise than with such rustic weapons as necessity sometimes converts to military purposes. boar-spears, scythes, flails, and the like, were their chief arms , for the normans, with the usual policy of conquerors, were jealous of permitting to the vanquished saxons the possession or the use of swords and spears. these circumstances rendered the assistance of the saxons far from being so formidable to the besieged, as the strength of the men themselves, their superior numbers, and the animation inspired by a just cause, might otherwise well have made them. it was to the leaders of this motley army that the letter of the templar was now delivered. reference was at first made to the chaplain for an exposition of its contents. "by the crook of st dunstan," said that worthy ecclesiastic, "which hath brought more sheep within the sheepfold than the crook of e'er another saint in paradise, i swear that i cannot expound unto you this jargon, which, whether it be french or arabic, is beyond my guess.". he then gave the letter to gurth, who shook his head gruffly, and passed it to wamba. the jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to locksley. "if the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, i might know something of the matter," said the brave yeoman , "but as the matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag that's at twelve miles distance.". "i must be clerk, then," said the black knight , and taking the letter from locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the meaning in saxon to his confederates. "execute the noble cedric . " exclaimed wamba , "by the rood, thou must be mistaken, sir knight.". "not i, my worthy friend," replied the knight, "i have explained the words as they are here set down.". "then, by st thomas of canterbury," replied gurth, "we will have the castle, should we tear it down with our hands . ". "we have nothing else to tear it with," replied wamba , "but mine are scarce fit to make mammocks of freestone and mortar.". "'tis but a contrivance to gain time," said locksley , "they dare not do a deed for which i could exact a fearful penalty.". "i would," said the black knight, "there were some one among us who could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands with the besieged. methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent, this holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure us the information we desire.". "a plague on thee, and thy advice . " said the pious hermit , "i tell thee, sir slothful knight, that when i doff my friar's frock, my priesthood, my sanctity, my very latin, are put off along with it , and when in my green jerkin, i can better kill twenty deer than confess one christian.". "i fear," said the black knight, "i fear greatly, there is no one here that is qualified to take upon him, for the nonce, this same character of father confessor . ". all looked on each other, and were silent. "i see," said wamba, after a short pause, "that the fool must be still the fool, and put his neck in the venture which wise men shrink from. you must know, my dear cousins and countrymen, that i wore russet before i wore motley, and was bred to be a friar, until a brain-fever came upon me and left me just wit enough to be a fool. i trust, with the assistance of the good hermit's frock, together with the priesthood, sanctity, and learning which are stitched into the cowl of it, i shall be found qualified to administer both worldly and ghostly comfort to our worthy master cedric, and his companions in adversity.". "hath he sense enough, thinkst thou . " said the black knight, addressing gurth. "i know not," said gurth , "but if he hath not, it will be the first time he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.". "on with the frock, then, good fellow," quoth the knight, "and let thy master send us an account of their situation within the castle. their numbers must be few, and it is five to one they may be accessible by a sudden and bold attack. time wears away with thee.". "and, in the meantime," said locksley, "we will beset the place so closely, that not so much as a fly shall carry news from thence. so that, my good friend," he continued, addressing wamba, "thou mayst assure these tyrants, that whatever violence they exercise on the persons of their prisoners, shall be most severely repaid upon their own.". "pax vobiscum," said wamba, who was now muffled in his religious disguise. and so saying he imitated the solemn and stately deportment of a friar, and departed to execute his mission. chapter xxvi. the hottest horse will oft be cool, the dullest will show fire , the friar will often play the fool, the fool will play the friar. old song. when the jester, arrayed in the cowl and frock of the hermit, and having his knotted cord twisted round his middle, stood before the portal of the castle of front-de-boeuf, the warder demanded of him his name and errand. "pax vobiscum," answered the jester, "i am a poor brother of the order of st francis, who come hither to do my office to certain unhappy prisoners now secured within this castle.". "thou art a bold friar," said the warder, "to come hither, where, saving our own drunken confessor, a cock of thy feather hath not crowed these twenty years.". "yet i pray thee, do mine errand to the lord of the castle," answered the pretended friar , "trust me it will find good acceptance with him, and the cock shall crow, that the whole castle shall hear him.". "gramercy," said the warder , "but if i come to shame for leaving my post upon thine errand, i will try whether a friar's grey gown be proof against a grey-goose shaft.". with this threat he left his turret, and carried to the hall of the castle his unwonted intelligence, that a holy friar stood before the gate and demanded instant admission. with no small wonder he received his master's commands to admit the holy man immediately , and, having previously manned the entrance to guard against surprise, he obeyed, without further scruple, the commands which he had received. the harebrained self-conceit which had emboldened wamba to undertake this dangerous office, was scarce sufficient to support him when he found himself in the presence of a man so dreadful, and so much dreaded, as reginald front-de-boeuf, and he brought out his "pax vobiscum", to which he, in a good measure, trusted for supporting his character, with more anxiety and hesitation than had hitherto accompanied it. but front-de-boeuf was accustomed to see men of all ranks tremble in his presence, so that the timidity of the supposed father did not give him any cause of suspicion. "who and whence art thou, priest . " said he. "'pax vobiscum'," reiterated the jester, "i am a poor servant of st francis, who, travelling through this wilderness, have fallen among thieves, as scripture hath it, 'quidam viator incidit in latrones', which thieves have sent me unto this castle in order to do my ghostly office on two persons condemned by your honourable justice.". "ay, right," answered front-de-boeuf , "and canst thou tell me, holy father, the number of those banditti . ". "gallant sir," answered the jester, "'nomen illis legio', their name is legion.". "tell me in plain terms what numbers there are, or, priest, thy cloak and cord will ill protect thee.". "alas . " said the supposed friar, "'cor meum eructavit', that is to say, i was like to burst with fear . but i conceive they may be what of yeomen what of commons, at least five hundred men.". "what . " said the templar, who came into the hall that moment, "muster the wasps so thick here . it is time to stifle such a mischievous brood." then taking front-de-boeuf aside "knowest thou the priest . ". "he is a stranger from a distant convent," said front-de-boeuf , "i know him not.". "then trust him not with thy purpose in words," answered the templar. "let him carry a written order to de bracy's company of free companions, to repair instantly to their master's aid. in the meantime, and that the shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely about his task of preparing these saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.". "it shall be so," said front-de-boeuf. and he forthwith appointed a domestic to conduct wamba to the apartment where cedric and athelstane were confined. the impatience of cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his confinement. he walked from one end of the hall to the other, with the attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach of a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculating to himself, sometimes addressing athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of the adventure, digesting, in the meantime, with great composure, the liberal meal which he had made at noon, and not greatly interesting himself about the duration of his captivity, which he concluded, would, like all earthly evils, find an end in heaven's good time. "'pax vobiscum'," said the jester, entering the apartment , "the blessing of st dunstan, st dennis, st duthoc, and all other saints whatsoever, be upon ye and about ye.". "enter freely," answered cedric to the supposed friar , "with what intent art thou come hither . ". "to bid you prepare yourselves for death," answered the jester. "it is impossible . " replied cedric, starting. "fearless and wicked as they are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty . ". "alas . " said the jester, "to restrain them by their sense of humanity, is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread. bethink thee, therefore, noble cedric, and you also, gallant athelstane, what crimes you have committed in the flesh , for this very day will ye be called to answer at a higher tribunal.". "hearest thou this, athelstane . " said cedric , "we must rouse up our hearts to this last action, since better it is we should die like men, than live like slaves.". "i am ready," answered athelstane, "to stand the worst of their malice, and shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever i did to my dinner.". "let us then unto our holy gear, father," said cedric. "wait yet a moment, good uncle," said the jester, in his natural tone , "better look long before you leap in the dark.". "by my faith," said cedric, "i should know that voice . ". "it is that of your trusty slave and jester," answered wamba, throwing back his cowl. "had you taken a fool's advice formerly, you would not have been here at all. take a fool's advice now, and you will not be here long.". "how mean'st thou, knave . " answered the saxon. "even thus," replied wamba , "take thou this frock and cord, which are all the orders i ever had, and march quietly out of the castle, leaving me your cloak and girdle to take the long leap in thy stead.". "leave thee in my stead . " said cedric, astonished at the proposal , "why, they would hang thee, my poor knave.". "e'en let them do as they are permitted," said wamba , "i trust no disparagement to your birth that the son of witless may hang in a chain with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman.". "well, wamba," answered cedric, "for one thing will i grant thy request. and that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with lord athelstane instead of me.". "no, by st dunstan," answered wamba , "there were little reason in that. good right there is, that the son of witless should suffer to save the son of hereward , but little wisdom there were in his dying for the benefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his.". "villain," said cedric, "the fathers of athelstane were monarchs of england . ". "they might be whomsoever they pleased," replied wamba , "but my neck stands too straight upon my shoulders to have it twisted for their sake. wherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or suffer me to leave this dungeon as free as i entered.". "let the old tree wither," continued cedric, "so the stately hope of the forest be preserved. save the noble athelstane, my trusty wamba . it is the duty of each who has saxon blood in his veins. thou and i will abide together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he, free and safe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us.". "not so, father cedric," said athelstane, grasping his hand, for, when roused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming his high race "not so," he continued , "i would rather remain in this hall a week without food save the prisoner's stinted loaf, or drink save the prisoner's measure of water, than embrace the opportunity to escape which the slave's untaught kindness has purveyed for his master.". "you are called wise men, sirs," said the jester, "and i a crazed fool , but, uncle cedric, and cousin athelstane, the fool shall decide this controversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any farther. i am like john-a-duck's mare, that will let no man mount her but john-a-duck. i came to save my master, and if he will not consent basta i can but go away home again. kind service cannot be chucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. i'll hang for no man but my own born master.". "go, then, noble cedric," said athelstane, "neglect not this opportunity. your presence without may encourage friends to our rescue your remaining here would ruin us all.". "and is there any prospect, then, of rescue from without . " said cedric, looking to the jester. "prospect, indeed . " echoed wamba , "let me tell you, when you fill my cloak, you are wrapped in a general's cassock. five hundred men are there without, and i was this morning one of the chief leaders. my fool's cap was a casque, and my bauble a truncheon. well, we shall see what good they will make by exchanging a fool for a wise man. truly, i fear they will lose in valour what they may gain in discretion. and so farewell, master, and be kind to poor gurth and his dog fangs , and let my cockscomb hang in the hall at rotherwood, in memory that i flung away my life for my master, like a faithful -fool.". the last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest and earnest. the tears stood in cedric's eyes. "thy memory shall be preserved," he said, "while fidelity and affection have honour upon earth . but that i trust i shall find the means of saving rowena, and thee, athelstane, and thee, also, my poor wamba, thou shouldst not overbear me in this matter.". the exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck cedric. "i know no language," he said, "but my own, and a few words of their mincing norman. how shall i bear myself like a reverend brother . ". "the spell lies in two words," replied wamba "'pax vobiscum' will answer all queries. if you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, 'pax vobiscum' carries you through it all. it is as useful to a friar as a broomstick to a witch, or a wand to a conjurer. speak it but thus, in a deep grave tone, 'pax vobiscum . ' it is irresistible watch and ward, knight and squire, foot and horse, it acts as a charm upon them all. i think, if they bring me out to be hanged to-morrow, as is much to be doubted they may, i will try its weight upon the finisher of the sentence.". "if such prove the case," said the master, "my religious orders are soon taken 'pax vobiscum'. i trust i shall remember the pass-word. noble athelstane, farewell , and farewell, my poor boy, whose heart might make amends for a weaker head i will save you, or return and die with you. the royal blood of our saxon kings shall not be spilt while mine beats in my veins , nor shall one hair fall from the head of the kind knave who risked himself for his master, if cedric's peril can prevent it. farewell.". "farewell, noble cedric," said athelstane , "remember it is the true part of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.".
