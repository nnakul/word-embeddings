the novice mrs. benson mary mrs. benson's correspondence with mrs. egerton miss evelyn eliza. there were three of us mary, eliza, and myself. i was approaching fifteen, mary was about a year younger, and eliza between twelve and thirteen years of age. mamma treated us all as children, and was blind to the fact that i was no longer what i had been. although not tall for my age, nor outwardly presenting a manly appearance, my passions were awakening, and the distinctive feature of my sex, although in repose it looked magnificent enough, was very sufficiently developed when under the influence of feminine excitement. as yet, i had absolutely no knowledge of the uses of the different organs of sex. my sisters and i all slept in the same room. they together in one bed, i alone in another. when no one was present, we had often mutually examined the different formations of our sexes. we had discovered that mutual handlings gave a certain amount of pleasing sensation , and, latterly, my eldest sister had discovered that the hooding and unhooding of my doodle, as she called it, instantly caused it to swell up and stiffen as hard as a piece of wood. my feeling of her little pinky slit gave rise in her to nice sensations, but on the slightest attempt to insert even my finger, the pain was too great. we had made so little progress in the attouchements that not the slightest inkling of what could be done in that way dawned upon us. i had begun to develop a slight growth of moss-like curls round the root of my cock , and then, to our surprise, mary began to show a similar tendency. as yet, eliza was as bald as her hand, but both were prettily formed, with wonderfully full and fat mounts of venus. we were perfectly innocent of guile and quite habituated to let each other look at all our naked bodies without the slightest hesitation , and when playing in the garden, if one wanted to relieve the pressure on the bladder, we all squatted down together, and crossed waters, each trying who could piddle fastest. notwithstanding these symptoms of passion when excited, in a state of calm i might have passed for a boy of ten or eleven. my father had left us but moderately provided for, and mamma, wishing to live comfortably, preferred giving me lessons along with my sisters at home to sending me to school , but her health beginning to fail, she inserted an advertisement in the times for a governess. out of a large number of applicants, a young lady, of the name of evelyn, was selected. some ten days afterwards she arrived, and became one of the family. we did not see much of her the first evening, but after breakfast the following morning, mamma accompanied her to what was considered our schoolroom, and said, "now, my dears, i place you under miss evelyn's care , you must obey her in all things , she will teach you your lessons, as i am unable to do so any longer." then, turning to our new governess, "i fear you will find them somewhat spoiled, and unruly , but there is a horse, and susan will make you excellent birch rods whenever you require them. if you spare their bottoms when they deserve whipping, you will seriously offend me." as mamma said this, i observed miss evelyn's eyes appeared to dilate with a sort of joy, and i felt certain that, severely as mamma had often whipped us, if we should now deserve it, miss evelyn would administer it much more severely. she looked amiability itself, and was truly beautiful in face and person, twenty-two years of age, full and finely formed, and dressed always with the most studied neatness. she was, in truth, a seductive creature. she made an instantaneous impression on my senses. there was, however, somewhat of a sternness of expression, and a dignity of carriage, which caused at once to fear and respect her. of course, at first, all went smoothly enough, and seeing that mamma treated me precisely as she did my sisters, i came to be regarded as quite a child by miss evelyn. she found that she had to sleep in the same room with my sisters and myself. i fancied that on the first night miss evelyn did not approve of this arrangement, but gradually became familiarized with it, and seemed to think no more about it. when bedtime came, we all kissed mamma and retired early, as usual. miss evelyn followed some hours later. when she came in, she carefully locked the door, then looked at me to see if i was asleep. why, i know not, but i was instinctively prompted to feign sleep. i did so successfully, notwithstanding the passing of the candle before my eyes. so she at once commenced undressing. when her back was turned, i opened my eyes, and greedily devoured her naked charms as they were gradually exhibited before me. the moment she turned round, i was again as if asleep. i have said that my passions had begun to develop themselves, but as yet i did not understand their force or direction. i well remember this first night, when a fine ripe woman gradually removed every particle of dress within a couple of yards of me the effect of each succeeding charm, from her lovely and beautifully formed bubbies to the taking off her shoes and stockings from her well-formed legs and small feet and ankles, caused my prick to swell and stiffen to a painful extent. when all but her chemise was removed, she stopped to pick up her petticoats that she had allowed to fall to her feet, and in lifting them, raised also her chemise, and exposed to my view a most glorious bottom dazzlingly white and shining like satin. as the light was full upon it, and she was still in a stooping position, i could see that below her slit she was well covered with dark hair. turning round, to put her petticoats on a chair, and to take up her nightgown, she slipped her chemise from her arm, and letting it fall to the ground while she lifted the nightgown over her head, i had for some seconds a view of her beautiful belly, thickly covered with dark curly hair over the mount of venus. so voluptuous was the sight, i almost shuddered, so intense was my excitement. she now sat down on the bed to take off her shoes and stockings. oh . what beautiful thighs, legs, ankles, and feet she had . . i am now advanced in life, and have had many handsome and well-formed women, but i never saw limbs more voluptuously formed. in a few minutes the light was extinguished, and a rushing rill flowed into the night vase , very different from the gentle tricklings from myself and sisters as we often squatted down opposite each other and crossed water, laughing at the different sources from which they flowed. my sisters often envied me the power of directing the spurt where i pleased, so little were we from dreaming of the real intent of that projecting little instrument. the ribs of two of these arches remained, though the roof had fallen down betwixt them , over the others it remained entire. the entrance to this ancient place of devotion was under a very low round arch, ornamented by several courses of that zig-zag moulding, resembling shark's teeth, which appears so often in the more ancient saxon architecture. a belfry rose above the porch on four small pillars, within which hung the green and weatherbeaten bell, the feeble sounds of which had been some time before heard by the black knight. the whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before the eyes of the traveller, giving him good assurance of lodging for the night , since it was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in the woods, to exercise hospitality towards benighted or bewildered passengers. accordingly, the knight took no time to consider minutely the particulars which we have detailed, but thanking saint julian the patron of travellers who had sent him good harbourage, he leaped from his horse and assailed the door of the hermitage with the butt of his lance, in order to arouse attention and gain admittance. it was some time before he obtained any answer, and the reply, when made, was unpropitious. "pass on, whosoever thou art," was the answer given by a deep hoarse voice from within the hut, "and disturb not the servant of god and st dunstan in his evening devotions.". "worthy father," answered the knight, "here is a poor wanderer bewildered in these woods, who gives thee the opportunity of exercising thy charity and hospitality.". "good brother," replied the inhabitant of the hermitage, "it has pleased our lady and st dunstan to destine me for the object of those virtues, instead of the exercise thereof. i have no provisions here which even a dog would share with me, and a horse of any tenderness of nurture would despise my couch pass therefore on thy way, and god speed thee.". "but how," replied the knight, "is it possible for me to find my way through such a wood as this, when darkness is coming on . i pray you, reverend father as you are a christian, to undo your door, and at least point out to me my road.". "and i pray you, good christian brother," replied the anchorite, "to disturb me no more. you have already interrupted one 'pater', two 'aves', and a 'credo', which i, miserable sinner that i am, should, according to my vow, have said before moonrise.". "the road the road . " vociferated the knight, "give me directions for the road, if i am to expect no more from thee.". "the road," replied the hermit, "is easy to hit. the path from the wood leads to a morass, and from thence to a ford, which, as the rains have abated, may now be passable. when thou hast crossed the ford, thou wilt take care of thy footing up the left bank, as it is somewhat precipitous , and the path, which hangs over the river, has lately, as i learn, for i seldom leave the duties of my chapel, given way in sundry places. thou wilt then keep straight forward -". "a broken path a precipice a ford, and a morass . " said the knight interrupting him, "sir hermit, if you were the holiest that ever wore beard or told bead, you shall scarce prevail on me to hold this road to-night. i tell thee, that thou, who livest by the charity of the country ill deserved, as i doubt it is hast no right to refuse shelter to the wayfarer when in distress. either open the door quickly, or, by the rood, i will beat it down and make entry for myself.". "friend wayfarer," replied the hermit, "be not importunate , if thou puttest me to use the carnal weapon in mine own defence, it will be e'en the worse for you.". at this moment a distant noise of barking and growling, which the traveller had for some time heard, became extremely loud and furious, and made the knight suppose that the hermit, alarmed by his threat of making forcible entry, had called the dogs who made this clamour to aid him in his defence, out of some inner recess in which they had been kennelled. incensed at this preparation on the hermit's part for making good his inhospitable purpose, the knight struck the door so furiously with his foot, that posts as well as staples shook with violence. the anchorite, not caring again to expose his door to a similar shock, now called out aloud, "patience, patience spare thy strength, good traveller, and i will presently undo the door, though, it may be, my doing so will be little to thy pleasure.". the door accordingly was opened , and the hermit, a large, strong-built man, in his sackcloth gown and hood, girt with a rope of rushes, stood before the knight. he had in one hand a lighted torch, or link, and in the other a baton of crab-tree, so thick and heavy, that it might well be termed a club. two large shaggy dogs, half greyhound half mastiff, stood ready to rush upon the traveller as soon as the door should be opened. but when the torch glanced upon the lofty crest and golden spurs of the knight, who stood without, the hermit, altering probably his original intentions, repressed the rage of his auxiliaries, and, changing his tone to a sort of churlish courtesy, invited the knight to enter his hut, making excuse for his unwillingness to open his lodge after sunset, by alleging the multitude of robbers and outlaws who were abroad, and who gave no honour to our lady or st dunstan, nor to those holy men who spent life in their service. "the poverty of your cell, good father," said the knight, looking around him, and seeing nothing but a bed of leaves, a crucifix rudely carved in oak, a missal, with a rough-hewn table and two stools, and one or two clumsy articles of furniture "the poverty of your cell should seem a sufficient defence against any risk of thieves, not to mention the aid of two trusty dogs, large and strong enough, i think, to pull down a stag, and of course, to match with most men.". "the good keeper of the forest," said the hermit, "hath allowed me the use of these animals, to protect my solitude until the times shall mend.". having said this, he fixed his torch in a twisted branch of iron which served for a candlestick , and, placing the oaken trivet before the embers of the fire, which he refreshed with some dry wood, he placed a stool upon one side of the table, and beckoned to the knight to do the same upon the other. they sat down, and gazed with great gravity at each other, each thinking in his heart that he had seldom seen a stronger or more athletic figure than was placed opposite to him. "reverend hermit," said the knight, after looking long and fixedly at his host, "were it not to interrupt your devout meditations, i would pray to know three things of your holiness , first, where i am to put my horse . secondly, what i can have for supper . thirdly, where i am to take up my couch for the night . ". "i will reply to you," said the hermit, "with my finger, it being against my rule to speak by words where signs can answer the purpose." so saying, he pointed successively to two corners of the hut. "your stable," said he, "is there your bed there , and," reaching down a platter with two handfuls of parched pease upon it from the neighbouring shelf, and placing it upon the table, he added, "your supper is here.". the knight shrugged his shoulders, and leaving the hut, brought in his horse, which in the interim he had fastened to a tree, unsaddled him with much attention, and spread upon the steed's weary back his own mantle. the hermit was apparently somewhat moved to compassion by the anxiety as well as address which the stranger displayed in tending his horse , for, muttering something about provender left for the keeper's palfrey, he dragged out of a recess a bundle of forage, which he spread before the knight's charger, and immediately afterwards shook down a quantity of dried fern in the corner which he had assigned for the rider's couch. the knight returned him thanks for his courtesy , and, this duty done, both resumed their seats by the table, whereon stood the trencher of pease placed between them. the hermit, after a long grace, which had once been latin, but of which original language few traces remained, excepting here and there the long rolling termination of some word or phrase, set example to his guest, by modestly putting into a very large mouth, furnished with teeth which might have ranked with those of a boar both in sharpness and whiteness, some three or four dried pease, a miserable grist as it seemed for so large and able a mill. the knight, in order to follow so laudable an example, laid aside his helmet, his corslet, and the greater part of his armour, and showed to the hermit a head thick-curled with yellow hair, high features, blue eyes, remarkably bright and sparkling, a mouth well formed, having an upper lip clothed with mustachoes darker than his hair, and bearing altogether the look of a bold, daring, and enterprising man, with which his strong form well corresponded. the hermit, as if wishing to answer to the confidence of his guest, threw back his cowl, and showed a round bullet head belonging to a man in the prime of life. his close-shaven crown, surrounded by a circle of stiff curled black hair, had something the appearance of a parish pinfold begirt by its high hedge. the features expressed nothing of monastic austerity, or of ascetic privations , on the contrary, it was a bold bluff countenance, with broad black eyebrows, a well-turned forehead, and cheeks as round and vermilion as those of a trumpeter, from which descended a long and curly black beard. such a visage, joined to the brawny form of the holy man, spoke rather of sirloins and haunches, than of pease and pulse. this incongruity did not escape the guest. after he had with great difficulty accomplished the mastication of a mouthful of the dried pease, he found it absolutely necessary to request his pious entertainer to furnish him with some liquor , who replied to his request by placing before him a large can of the purest water from the fountain. "it is from the well of st dunstan," said he, "in which, betwixt sun and sun, he baptized five hundred heathen danes and britons blessed be his name . " and applying his black beard to the pitcher, he took a draught much more moderate in quantity than his encomium seemed to warrant. "it seems to me, reverend father," said the knight, "that the small morsels which you eat, together with this holy, but somewhat thin beverage, have thriven with you marvellously. you appear a man more fit to win the ram at a wrestling match, or the ring at a bout at quarter-staff, or the bucklers at a sword-play, than to linger out your time in this desolate wilderness, saying masses, and living upon parched pease and cold water.". "sir knight," answered the hermit, "your thoughts, like those of the ignorant laity, are according to the flesh. it has pleased our lady and my patron saint to bless the pittance to which i restrain myself, even as the pulse and water was blessed to the children shadrach, meshech, and abednego, who drank the same rather than defile themselves with the wine and meats which were appointed them by the king of the saracens.". "holy father," said the knight, "upon whose countenance it hath pleased heaven to work such a miracle, permit a sinful layman to crave thy name . ". "thou mayst call me," answered the hermit, "the clerk of copmanhurst, for so i am termed in these parts they add, it is true, the epithet holy, but i stand not upon that, as being unworthy of such addition. and now, valiant knight, may i pray ye for the name of my honourable guest . ". "truly," said the knight, "holy clerk of copmanhurst, men call me in these parts the black knight, many, sir, add to it the epithet of sluggard, whereby i am no way ambitious to be distinguished.". the hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guest's reply. "i see," said he, "sir sluggish knight, that thou art a man of prudence and of counsel , and moreover, i see that my poor monastic fare likes thee not, accustomed, perhaps, as thou hast been, to the license of courts and of camps, and the luxuries of cities , and now i bethink me, sir sluggard, that when the charitable keeper of this forest-walk left those dogs for my protection, and also those bundles of forage, he left me also some food, which, being unfit for my use, the very recollection of it had escaped me amid my more weighty meditations.".
